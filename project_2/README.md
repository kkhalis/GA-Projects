# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Problem Statement
The Ames Housing board is looking to see how we can predict the prices of future houses, based on a list of features. These features are a combination of nominal, ordinal, continuous and discrete values.

To do that, the board has tasked you and the team to create a prediction model that can predict the prices of houses within Ames, given a list of features that may or may not contribute to the sale price of a house.
Welcome to Project 2! It's time to start modeling.

### Contents
* Data import, helper functions, cleaning and mapping of ordinal values
* EDA: Previewing Data and Highlighting Outliers
* Testing on Various Regression Models
* Applying our selected model on the Kaggle test set
* Conclusion

### Datasets
2 datasets have been used for this project as shown below:

* [`test.csv`](./datasets/train.csv): 2006 to 2010 housing information of Ames, Iowa. Inclusive of SalePrice
* [`new_test.csv`](./datasets/new_test.csv): Kaggle test set to use to predict house prices.

### Data Dictionary
You can access the data dictionary, split into markdown format [*here*](https://github.com/kkhalis/GA-Projects/blob/master/project_2/DataDictionary.md).
