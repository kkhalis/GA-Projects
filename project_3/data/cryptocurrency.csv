Some people were very adamant about this feeling and I never truly understood why until watching [this](https://youtu.be/3qu-DQo2m64?t=3016) video.  The vid should be timestamped but the relevant part is from 50:30 to 51:50 (shout out the the boxmining channel whose vid this is referencing).

Having only been involved in crypto this year, I missed all the early day mass disasters like MT Gox and Bitconnect (HEYHEYHEYHEY).  So I was in the same camp as most new people wondering ""why is it such a big deal"".  That clip did a great job of really showing the frustration and emotion of someone who experienced one of those disasters first hand and why most who advocate so hard for cold wallets do so.  I can't imagine having a lot of money locked up in legal bullshit for *years* with no real resolution in sight.

I don't think true adoption happens until people can have trustworthy exchange or, more ideally, easily interact with decentralized Dapps on Defi.  But we're definitely a long way from that and I think the ""not your keys, not your coin"" crowd are still very right.

A mutually beneficial move that could see Wrexham turned into the first major fan owned DAO. I have detailed how I believe the process should work below but for those who aren’t British or football (soccer) fans, I’ll give a little background information about Wrexham football club. Wrexham A.F.C is the oldest football (soccer) club in Wales and third oldest club on the planet, founded in 1864. It’s had an incredible history - playing in numerous different leagues and beating some of the biggest names in English and European football.

In 2020 Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney announced they would be taking over the club. The deal received the backing of 98.6% of the 2,000 members of the Wrexham Support Trust and was completed in February 2021. Almost all Wrexham A.F.C fans were incredibly happy with deal, as they recognised the deal would bring significant financial investment and public awareness to Wrexham A.F.C.

**What’s their vision?** I imagine their aim is to firstly bring as much attention to Wrexham A.F.C as possible through their enormous social media following; exponentially increasing the fan base. Their next aim will be to improve the standard of football through financial investment. By doing this Wrexham will move up leagues, which will introduce them to larger fan bases and financial rewards. As you can see these go hand in hand, creating a virtuous cycle. fans &gt; investment &gt; winning &gt; fans. Throughout this process, a documentary will be created that will be shown on Netflix, further reinforcing the cycle.

**Turning Wrexham A.F.C into a DAO?** I believe Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney should turn Wrexham A.F.C into the first major sports club owned DAO. In a DAO, a network of peers encodes its protocols for decision-making into secure, decentralised software (often smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain). This software becomes the arbiter that tallies votes and carries out the will of the people. Imagine hundreds of thousands of individuals working collectively to solve problems, with rewards distributed according to value contributed, and decisions being made through the wisdom of the crowd.

**How would this work with Wrexham A.F.C?** A billion ‘WRX’ tokens could be created which fans or speculators could purchase bringing immediate investment to Wrexham A.F.C. These tokens would be used for a number of things: voting on the direction of the club and day to day decisions, receiving rewards if the club were to make a profit and maybe even offering unique access to merchandise and other deals. The possibilities are endless.

**Why would this work?** The above is ‘fantasy league’ on steroids. Imagine being financially involved and part of the decision making process of your team and if your team does well, you are financially rewarded for it. For example, fans would be involved in the signing of players, hiring of scouts, choosing coaches and deciding the formation of the team. As crypto fans, we know how passionate people get about their favourite tokens. So imagine how passionate fans would get about managing a football (soccer) club in real time that they’re financially invested in.

**Why Wrexham A.F.C?** I believe a fan owned DAO would work for almost any sports team. But someone’s got to be the first to do it and prove that it works. Reynolds and McElhenney are uniquely placed to attract huge support through leveraging their celebrity status. A few instagram posts, tweets and public appearances would bring the existence of the token to the awareness of people all around the world. The fact they are making a documentary will also allow them to stream this process in real time (making the documentary significantly more interesting).

**Who benefits?** I think everyone would benefit. Wrexham A.F.C would gain an enormous amount of fans and investment. Reynolds and McElhenney would bring far more attention to themselves and Wreham through creating a token and a DAO and they also would not have to invest as much of their own money. Token holders would hopefully financially benefit, enjoy being part of the decision making process of a football club and also be part of what could potentially be the future of sport and organisations.

Below are some of the top questions, imo. [You can find the full FAQ here](https://algorand.foundation/gov-faq#community-governance-)

Note Q18. I have a ledger nano x and it's connect to the iOS Alogrand Wallet. I believe this will be okay no problem for governance.

&gt;**Q12: Is everyone who holds Algo tokens automatically signed up to Community Governance?** 

&gt;No, Algo holders are not automatically signed up to Community Governance. Algo holders will need to go to the Governance web portal (which will be available on Oct 1st) and declare how many Algo tokens they will commit to each Community Governance period. To participate, governors will have to sign a transaction to signify their commitment. The Governance web portal can be used to generate a transaction of the right format. A signed transaction to this effect will be required to participate, which you can create via the Governance web portal. 

&gt;**Q13: Do I need to provide any identification (KYC) to participate in Community Governance?**

&gt;No, there are no requirements to do so.

&gt;**Q17: Can I use any wallet to participate in Governance?**

&gt;Yes. AlgoSigner, MyAlgoWallet, and the Official Algorand Wallet will be the easiest to use but any wallet which includes a notes field will also facilitate participation in Community Governance.

&gt;**Q18: Will participation in governance be available using a Ledger Nano device? Will I be able to stake using my Ledger device?** 

&gt;You can use your Ledger device to participate in Community Governance with any wallet that has Ledger integration with support of a transaction notes field.  If using Ledger Live, you will not be able to participate as LL does not support a transaction notes field.

&gt;**Q19: I have an account with an exchange. Will major exchanges facilitate participation in Community Governance?** 

&gt;With exchanges you do not have your own wallet address.

Most of the items we are using right now on commercial purposes are 'outdated' specs of an item which were used by the army. 

History of radar, and technology in general are somewhat linked to militarization of the technology and how it ended up being mass produced. 

The question lies in- how are state actors militarizing blockchain? 

In a article titled ""Weaponizing Blockchain"" by Lilly and Lilly (2021), the authors examined the use of Blockchain technology in the US, China and Russia. These are the brief findings on what blockchain are being used for.

The main findings suggests that; 

1. Blockchain military applications are not 'combat ready' as of yet.
2. The irony in decentralized governance in a top-down structure. 
3. Distributed ledgers and smart contracts could remove government's key features and present a faster operating military units.

 Historically, technologies adopted by the military would eventually be mass produced. I hope you can see where this is going. Blockchain has significance in the next generation of autonomy. We are just getting started.

I was speaking to a friend of mine who is well into his crypto and he said that I should just buy a huge amount of a USD coin (which is always worth $1 so no volatility) and then stake it, earning ""8-10% easily"", sometimes upwards of 20% APY is apparently possible.

My question really is: is this sound advice?

I currently have £10k invested in various crypto currencies (ETH, SOL, ADA, etc.) but I understand that these investments are a gamble. The value of the crypto may well go down. However, the USD coins will always be worth $1 so is it really as easy as:

Step 1 - buy lots of USD coin
Step 2 - stake
Step 3 - earn very high interest rates
Step 4 - retire?

It seems too good to be true...

Alternatively, I could buy a stable coin like BTC or ETH and then just stake that instead. The interest rates don't seem to be as good, and of course the value of the stable coin could collapse (seems unlikely) thus nullifying the interest earned.

I'll try and keep this as short and sweet as possible.  

You may have noticed or (hopefully) be familiar with the fact that when you open a leveraged position on a crypto exchange, that the exchanges calculates your ""liquidation point"".  This the point where your losses in your account are equal to your equity.  Lets call it the REKT point! because if the market gets to this price then you are most definately getting rekt.

If you can imagine things from the point of view of the exchange, their order book for any instrument will have a huge collection of liquidation points from each individual trader.  Take a look a the picture i've provided of a group of liquidation points placed by a group of highlky leveraged traders.  

In the picture the ""Y"" represents how much money those traders will lose as a group if those liquidations are triggered.

Now if you are the exchange, and you can see all the orders between the current market price and the liquidation points, then if you wanted to drive the price up to that level, you know exactly how much that will cost you.  Lets call this cost X.

The exchanges engines are constantly looking for situations where the profit from a cluster of liquidations ""Y"" is greater than the cost to trigger those liquidations ""X"".

All the exchange has to do is temporarily take the other side of the liquidations whilst they are triggering them and then BOOM, they INSTANTLY GET TO KEEP ALL THE LIQUIDATED CASH.

Your liquidation goes straight into their pocket.

This is why exchanges love to offer you huge leverage, because the more they offer you, the more you use and the closer your liquidation points are to the market, and therefore cheaper and easier to pick off.

The simple solution is this: Either use no leverage, or if you must, then keep it as low as possible.

This keeps your liquidation point far away from the market price and stops you from painting a target on your head that says ""Please Liquidate Me!""

I would personally say that when you are first starting to use leverage, it should be no more than 1.5:1 or 2:1.  Once you are an experienced trader, the absolute maximum I would say you ever should use is 5:1, and I stress that this is the maximum, really I'd say 3:1 for most assets, 5:1 for the least volatile.

A mutually beneficial move that could see Wrexham turned into the first major fan owned DAO. I have detailed how I believe the process should work below but for those who aren’t British or football (soccer) fans, I’ll give a little background information about Wrexham football club. Wrexham A.F.C is the oldest football (soccer) club in Wales and third oldest club on the planet, founded in 1864. It’s had an incredible history - playing in numerous different leagues and beating some of the biggest names in English and European football. 

In 2020 Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney announced they would be taking over the club. The deal received the backing of 98.6% of the 2,000 members of the Wrexham Support Trust and was completed in February 2021. Almost all Wrexham A.F.C fans were incredibly happy with deal, as they recognised the deal would bring significant financial investment and public awareness to Wrexham A.F.C.

**What’s their vision?** I imagine their aim is to firstly bring as much attention to Wrexham A.F.C as possible through their enormous social media following; exponentially increasing the fan base. Their next aim will be to improve the standard of football through financial investment. By doing this Wrexham will move up leagues, which will introduce them to larger fan bases and financial rewards. As you can see these go hand in hand, creating a virtuous cycle. fans &gt; investment &gt; winning &gt; fans. Throughout this process, a documentary will be created that will be shown on Netflix, further reinforcing the cycle.

**Turning Wrexham A.F.C into a DAO?** I believe Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney should turn Wrexham A.F.C into the first major sports club owned DAO. In a DAO, a network of peers encodes its protocols for decision-making into secure, decentralised software (often smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain). This software becomes the arbiter that tallies votes and carries out the will of the people. Imagine hundreds of thousands of individuals working collectively to solve problems, with rewards distributed according to value contributed, and decisions being made through the wisdom of the crowd. 

**How would this work with Wrexham A.F.C?** A billion ‘WRX’ tokens could be created which fans or speculators could purchase bringing immediate investment to Wrexham A.F.C. These tokens would be used for a number of things: voting on the direction of the club and day to day decisions, receiving rewards if the club were to make a profit and maybe even offering unique access to merchandise and other deals. The possibilities are endless.

**Why would this work?** The above is ‘fantasy league’ on steroids. Imagine being financially involved and part of the decision making process of your team and if your team does well, you are financially rewarded for it. For example, fans would be involved in the signing of players, hiring of scouts, choosing coaches and deciding the formation of the team. As crypto fans, we know how passionate people get about their favourite tokens. So imagine how passionate fans would get about managing a football (soccer) club in real time that they’re financially invested in.

**Why Wrexham A.F.C?** I believe a fan owned DAO would work for almost any sports team. But someone’s got to be the first to do it and prove that it works. Reynolds and McElhenney are uniquely placed to attract huge support through leveraging their celebrity status. A few instagram posts, tweets and public appearances would bring the existence of the token to the awareness of people all around the world. The fact they are making a documentary will also allow them to stream this process in real time (making the documentary significantly more interesting). 

**Who benefits?** I think everyone would benefit. Wrexham A.F.C would gain an enormous amount of fans and investment. Reynolds and McElhenney would bring far more attention to themselves and Wreham through creating a token and a DAO and they also would not have to invest as much of their own money.

Crypto industry is living through its nascent booming stage, where in a space of just 12 years it evolved from the Bitcoin creation to now attempts to satisfy individual’s and organization’s financial needs.

We are at the most important moment of connecting outside of crypto entities to growing decentralized new world. There are not now many organizations that serve as a financial bridge. One of them is Goldfinch. The endeavor that Godfinch is embarking on is prone to possible fund losses, in this case just like any ordinary bank.   In plain lending, we have two or three sides, that is a borrower, bank and maybe insurer, but Goldfinch proposes innovative approach, that is Borrower, Auditor, Backer and lastly Liquidity Provider. Process starts with Borrowers applying for capital and proposing terms on which it is ready to borrow, that’s interest rate, limit, payment etc. Borrower may create for that matter smart contract and apply to Backers, who may accept or not those terms. That is because Backers are first-loss bearers and in case of default they would the first to sustain losses. Backer’s responsibility is to check Borrowers and decide whether they like that investment opportunity. Here come into stage Auditors who analyze and secure protocol against possible frauds. Without Auditors approval, Borrowers cannot get needed funds. Auditors have only 48 hours to vote their verdict, namely Full Approval, No Approval, Backer-only Approval (only suppliers are Backers). 

Than if, approved Borrower can get access to money, which is in combined so-called Senior and Junior pool. Junior pool is comprised of funds from Backers and Senior from Liquidity Providers. Bulk of the capital in Senior pool and distribution of funds is done through Trust Consensus which assigns trust marks to each Borrower pool. Higher trust marks means more leverage. Supplying capital to Senior pool is fully permissionless and is compensated by passive yield. Although 20% of Senior pool interest is allocated to Backers , for serving as first-loss buffer.  Governance is done by community DAO, which is now widely used in other DEFI. There are  Governance tokens, GFI that are used in many aspects here , for example by rewarding Backers , staking by Auditors to be selected, staking by Borrowers for approval etc.

###Introduction    

Solana is a public [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) platform. It is open-source and [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing), with consensus achieved using [proof of stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) and proof of history. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, SOL, and claims to support 50,000 transactions per second.     

Solana proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof of History (PoH) - a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events. PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger - an append only data structure. When used alongside a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake(PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant replicated state machine, resulting in sub-second ﬁnality times. It also proposes two algorithms that leverage the time keeping properties of the PoH ledger - a PoS algorithm that can recover from partitions of any size and an eﬃcient streaming Proof of Replication (PoRep). The combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense against forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and storage. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and it shows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible with todays hardware.     

On 14 September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline for approximately 17 hours after a surge of transactions caused the network to [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)), and different validators had different views on the state of the network. The network was successfully brought back online early on 15 September Solana said the network downtime was the result of a [denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).     

###Inception    

Solana was created in April 2019 by computer scientist Anatoly Yakovenko, graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Bachelor of Computer Science 1999-2003.

Currently working as a CEO of Solana Labs he also led the development of Solana along with two other ex-Qualcomm engineers he previously worked with at Qualcomm as an engineer and Raj Gokal, an entrepreneur who previously worked in the digital-health sector.

###Technology    

Solana uses Proof-of-history (PoH) as it's blockchain architecture to achieve high transaction speed at minimal cost. 

Poof of History is a sequence of computation that can provide a way to cryptographically verify passage of time between two events. It uses a cryptographically secure function written so that output cannot be predicted from the input, and must be completely executed to generate the output. The function is run in a sequence on a single core, its previous output as the current input, periodically recording the current output, and how many times its been called. The output can then be recomputed and veriﬁed by external computers in parallel by checking each sequence segment on a separate core. Data can be timestamped into this sequence by appending the data (or a hash of some data) into the state of the function.     

The recording of the state, index and data as it was appended into the sequences provides a timestamp that can guarantee that the data was created some time before the next hash was generated in the sequence. This design also supports horizontal scaling as multiple generators can synchronize amongst each other by mixing their state into each others sequences.

I want to start to release our artist work as NFT's, as well as being released in the usual places like Beatport for sale, Spotify for streaming etc.

I've been looking at various music based NFT market places and streaming platforms, but none of them have really wowed me, I guess most are still very early in their development. Audious seems slick for streaming, but pays even less than Spotify, as it doesn't really pay. None of the marketplaces seem great, as a user, I would want to be able to buy a track as a single, at a price point similar to what I would pay on Beatport, so around £1.50. Yet the cost of minting seems prohibitive, the lack of ability to run multiple copies of the same track from one mint is also a problem for many, which is why people are attempting to sell things for such silly prices, which just won't be sustainable for a long term project to actually break into the mainstream market.

My question is... Does anyone know if it also works the same way when you transfer from Coinbase back to your bank? Because long story short I had an auto payment come out a day early, and it over drew my bank account by $8. I get paid at midnight, but if I don't replace the funds by 5pm today I get hit with a $39 overdraft fee.

So rather than drive to the bank in flash floods we're getting on the east coast, I was thinking of just transferring some money from Coinbase to the bank... But I don't know if it'll post the same day or not. Just figured people here might have had experience and know the answer.

-Take a step back from the obstacle and be content
-Stay right up against that obstacle and be the victim
-Look for a way around that obstacle

Back here with another post. YOu may wonder why TRAC has been going up while the whole market was down. This is due to some big news in recent events. I'm updating you on two recent blockchain events/gatherings (yesterday and day before) where OriginTrail and two of their partners (Home Depot and British Standards Institution) spoke about their usage of the OriginTrail Decentralised Knowlegde Graph.

https://preview.redd.it/rm8jwycoi8p71.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f052424eb97d864e203549f2b76e6c719962e7b4

# First up was the event hosted by OriginTrail. Frictionless International Trade.

Watch it back here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLUVBtnGCLw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLUVBtnGCLw)

Ken McElroy is the global manager of trade risk &amp; export compliance at Home Depot. He was invited to speak on their (Home Depot) usage of the OriginTrail network. I've  highlighted the most interesting quotes from Ken expanding on the relationship between Home Depot and OriginTrail:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Everybody wants their data protected, they want their supply chain as anonymous as it can be. What OriginTrail and BSI and SCAN have accomplished is the ability to have competitors sharing compliance information on facilities that they are doing business with, without knowing who of their competitors are doing business with the same locations.""

In technical terms, this quote relates to the usage of ZK-Snarks in the OriginTrail network, where partners can share sensitive information without giving up the exact details of the information.  


&gt;""The beauty of this technology going forward is the owners of the data own the permission for who can have access to it. So it's a complete shift. That's where I think the beauty of where we're going with secure data exchanges is going to be going forward""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I am really passionate about the fact that most of what supply chains do is really generate costs as opposed to generating revenue. So one of the things that we've been able to accomplish in the last 6 years of my career is launching a trustable platform that actually generates return on investment from what would normally be considered a cost center in a supply chain. The fact that we can arrange this and have it be trustworthy is really attributable to the fact that we have a verifiable, trusted blockchain environment that allows us to share that data.""

Ken explains here that using the blockchain environment actually transforms a cost center to a revenue generating item. Sharing the data, trusted via the OriginTrail Decentralised Knowledge Graph doesn't cost them money. It makes them money. It's profitable for businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Where we're tying to take this going forward is really to say we're trying to take this to the point where we can create an end data flow verifiable trace of where a product starts in the supply chain and manufacture to where it lands at destination ultimately to the retail shelf, so that anyone can take a verifiable UPC scannable detail and say ok this product came from point A to point B through this this and this network or interchange without any tampering or whatever, so that's really the innovation that ( British Standards Institution Director of Innovation ) Dan ( Purtell, also in attendance ) was highlighting before. The fact that we have the ability to link data from different organizations and put that together, that's really the cutting edge perspective I think from a supply chain perspective in today's market.""

This part is really exciting and expands on their vision of using OriginTrail for end to end tracing of every product. This also ties in really nicely to the GS1 Digital Link barcode OriginTrail is heavily involved in. (Making every barcode basically smart and scannable for consumers to get valuable information.

&amp;#x200B;

# The second event I want to highlight is the European Blockchain Week Event. 

Watch it back here: [https://youtu.be/KKgqGpZablw?t=25149](https://youtu.be/KKgqGpZablw?t=25149)

Ken McElroy is also the Board Vice Chair of SCAN Association. (A Supplier Compliance Audit Network including Walmart, Home Depot, Walt Disney.) ([https://www.scanassociation.com/about/](https://www.scanassociation.com/about/)). This event he talked more from the angle of SCAN using OriginTrail. He is back again with some juicy quotes:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Let me just say that it's been kind enough to partner with BSI and OriginTrail to really take a circumstance where competitors in the marketplace are able to utilize technology to provide value added services to their individual organizations while maintaining the integrity of their own proprietary data.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""It's really something that if you'd asked me 35 years ago as a young practitioner in supply chain that i would be at the time sharing manufacturing and supply chain details with proctor &amp; gamble working for colgate palmolive i would have laughed, we were dead against each other with regard to the competitive landscape and would NOT have even dreamed of that. fast forward to today and here we have a workable business case where some of the largest manufacturing and retail organization in the world particularly in the US market space are doing exactly that.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Suffice to say it's 1.4 trillion dollars and growing every year. there's 22,000 factories in our repository and our criteria align directly with US customs recently upgraded minimum security criteria that has been created in 2019 after initially being created in 2001.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Where we are looking to take this and how we expect we can grow this is we can then add permissioned access to regulatory agencies AEO organizations, other government agencies such as the US FDA, US Customs and specifically give them the ability to see the results of these particular audits.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Just let me say this before we move on i think that the opportunity that we presented from a trusted trader perspective with regulatory agencies is a complete and total paradigm shift potentially in supply chain security, the ability to have regulatory agencies take data that is generated and gathered and marry that with their own internal intelligence to do things like security targeting could affectively change supply chains security going forward and take us into the next several decades going forward.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The concepts of shared data and frictionless supply chain really say a lot about how we can take technology and allow things like taking data flow, taking information and combining that information to allow for a forward looking speedy release of goods through the enablization of the blockchain and data elements that the regulatory agencies are obligated to take into consideration but if we're able to maintain and demonstrate those kinds of touch point connections that can take what would've been a container of fruits and vegetables coming through the suez canal sitting in place for many days or longer but allowing the data points to say ok that container was never outside it's temp realms, we have the touch points for where it's loaded and where it's going to. we can with relative integrity verify that those realities took place and then release that container to the consumer or the consumer chain without any further delay. that's just a simple example of think of where this reality has a profound practical delivery purpose and where i think we're gonna go in the future as we expand these footprints into other regulatory agencies and ecosystems.""

&amp;#x200B;

Investors are giving up on gold and moving on to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone.

What Happened: McGlone said in an interview with Stansberry Research that he underestimated the outflows from gold to the major cryptocurrencies this year, with the limited supply of cryptocurrencies overtaking the precious metal.

&gt;As the products are traded on-exchange, investors no longer have to turn to unregulated trading venues to invest in cryptocurrencies.

&gt;With Xetra, they can rely on the largest exchange-based ETF trading venue in Europe with an accordingly high level of liquidity and the highest regulatory standards.

&gt;Investors do not need to set up their own crypto wallets or cryptographic keys because the products are traded on-exchange.

The Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Points At Fear
The BTC fear and greed index is an indicator that measures the sentiment and emotions of the market based on various sources, and displays them on a numeric meter.
The metric uses a system with 0-100 as values, where low values indicate fear in the market, and higher ones show greed.
Extreme fear and greed occur when the indicator shows very low or very high values, respectively. Periods of fear usually happen when Bitcoin goes in the red, while those of greed are seen during big moves up.

Last week the indicator slowly started shifting towards greed as the market recovered from the crash of 7 September. However, before the greed level could be hit, sentiment quickly turned into fear as BTC had yet another crash.


The fear and greed needle points at fear currently.
Over the last few days, Bitcoin has had two big dips where the price went down to $40.5k in the first one, but all the way down to $39.6k in the second one. These have only fed into the fear sentiment.

#Will These Fear Levels Hold Buyers Back From The Halloween Effect?

The Halloween Strategy is a trading method that’s based on the idea that stocks, Bitcoin and other assets perform the best between 31 October and 1 May.
Traders using the strategy generally recommend “to sell in May and go away,” until the next Halloween comes around.
Because of this idea, buyers usually see this time of the year as an optimal entry point into the market. This is sometimes dubbed as the “Halloween Effect.”
The effect is a weird statistical anomaly as data over a period of a few years suggests the trading strategy does seem to produce better results.
Next month is the Halloween month, but will the effect attract buyers to Bitcoin this time? As the fear and greed index shows fear among traders currently, investors might be hesitant to enter the market right now.
If the market continues to show fear through the next month, then perhaps the Halloween Effect won’t benefit BTC this year.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3495038,public,self,Will Fear And Greed Keep Bitcoin Buyers From The Halloween Effect?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ptss4z/will_fear_and_greed_keep_bitcoin_buyers_from_the/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The SEC is using a horrible excuse to go after Crypto. They are constantly waging a propaganda campaign against Crypto. To state their own concerns, they call Crypto a ""flavor of the year for fraudsters"". Yet despite them trying to look like saints, they continue to lobby for banks. 

They call Crypto a ponzi scheme while completely ignoring the shit banks do. The entire purpose of banks is to take your money and scam you by giving you a horrible interest rate while using the same money to loan to others and saddle them with debt using high interest rates. If this doesn't sound like a scam or a ponzi scheme, then I don't know what is.

Moreover, their entire motive for going after Crypto is to save banks. Imagine if everyone knew about Crypto. Who the fuck on earth would deposit their money into banks for a 0.01% interest rate while they could put that money into any Crypto exchange for an interest rate hundeds or even thousands of times more? Their entire pursuit is to stop Crypto from giving banks a run for their money. 

These people have a mindset from the 19th century and are funded by banks. They keep trying to convince people that banks are superior and that [Crypto world last long](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-gensler-doesnt-see-cryptocurrencies-lasting-long-11632246355).

But alas, Crypto is used for scams right? I mean, even if you look at some of the most high level Crypto scams, it is nothing considered to the scams you can fall for using banks and fiat. Banks themselves are scamming people at an institutional level. Yet these people ignore banks because their paycheck relies on them.

Love this community and was wondering if you could help me answer a riddle for me.

I really like the idea behind IOTA, the idea of multiple little nodes, each person validating 2/3 transactions. Also if it massively scales, this would be decentralisation in purest form, by my reasoning.

All of this could hypothetically result in  zero fees, speed and potentially something become far more environmentally friendly. 

In terms of tokeconomics, the no of IOTAs is roughly not much more than total number of Satoshis. And it makes sense to measure at this micro level (ie sathoshis / not BTC level) due to the nature of micro transactions.

I  know it had sketchy beginnings, but with deals emerging with the EU &amp; Smart contracts landing, feels like it may have turned a corner.

Finally, there was a lot of general cynicism toward BTC in the beginning, only a hardcore few really got it...but  mindsets have changed.

Genuinely interested, why am i wrong?

&gt;Company’s shares surge 11% as retail trading venue goes toe to toe with Coinbase.

&gt;Robinhood said on Wednesday it would begin offering crypto wallets on its platform, putting the fast-growing retail stock brokerage in direct competition with more established digital currency venues such as Coinbase.

&gt;The wallets will allow Robinhood customers to directly own and transfer bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in order to pay for goods and services, rather than simply trade crypto as is currently allowed. Shares in Robinhood rose 11 per cent on Wednesday, lifting its market capitalisation to $40bn.


&gt;Robinhood said it expected to begin testing the wallets with a small group of customers in October before expanding the offering to its more than 32m registered users. Almost 300,000 customers signed up for the wallet wait-list within hours of the announcement, according to information posted on the Robinhood app.

&gt;Cryptocurrency trading accounted for $233m of Robinhood’s revenue in the second quarter of this year, up from $5m in the same quarter in 2020.

&gt;About 60 per cent of funded accounts on the platform traded cryptocurrency of some kind during the second quarter, the broker said. Sixty-two per cent of cryptocurrency transaction revenue during that period was derived from trading in dogecoin, which was originally conceived as a joke and was championed by Elon Musk.

&gt;The brokerage’s cryptocurrency assets under custody hit $22.7bn at the end of the period, 29 times greater than the previous year.

Over 100 million Euros of EURL has been traded on Coinhouse in under 6 months. At this point, the stablecoin has only been marketed to Coinhouse customers in Europe.

The Tezos-based stablecoin was launched by Lugh, a Groupe Casino company in partnership with SCEME, Société Générale, PwC and Coinhouse.

# The EURL Stablecoin

The EURL is a French stablecoin backed by the Euro and is built on the Tezos blockchain. XTZ News previously covered the EURL in an article found here.

It was launched by Lugh, a Groupe Casino company in partnership with SCEME, Société Générale, PwC and Coinhouse. It has so far only been marketed to Coinhouse in Europe.

According to a message on LinkedIn from Lugh, over 100 million in transaction volume for the EURL stablecoin has taken place on Coinhouse. Translated:

***“A few month after our launch, more than 100 M€ of EURL has already been traded on Coinhouse !“***

Also, do I have to pay eth gas fees every time I list something? can it be avoided somehow with WETH or something internal? does that mean that every offer I make would cost me fees?

Is it possible to see all the code used for the project and understand if some fuckery is going on? or even if I see it, would I even understand anything without solidity knowledge?

[https://safetrading.today/traders/crypto-classics/](https://safetrading.today/traders/crypto-classics/) gave a good rating to this group and marked them as approved.

Moreover, SafeTrading lists a lot of crypto signal providers, both approved ones and scammers.

I thus deduced that they were reliable. I contacted Crypto Classics yesterday and they made me send 400 USDT for an annual subscription. It would take some to sign me up. Today, I discovered that damian\_classics blocked me on Telegram without signing me up.

I hereby want to warn everyone for them. I don't understand why I couldn't find any reports about scams from either of them yet. I also don't understand why SafeTrading would list them as safe on their website, unless SafeTrading is in cahoots with them and all other approved crypto signal providers on their website, which seems mind-boggling to me.

Countries that I'm aware of.

Switzerland: No tax unless you trade professionally. I think as long as you have a job and don't outearn your income you should be safe.

Portugal: Tax free. ""The Portuguese tax authorities are quoted as saying that “an exchange of cryptocurrency for ‘real’ currency constitutes an on-demand, VAT-free exercise of services.” If you're trading professionally you'll probably be liable for taxes though.

Dubai UAE: No income tax country but there is a 5% VAT on purchases of gold. The legal situation is unclear if this VAT applies to cryptos. Banks are generally not crypto friendly. There are freezones with crypto agreements which means you can most likely get around it there if you trade as a business and get a license there but details scarce so you'll have to inquire.

El Salvador: Bukele made BTC legal tender. The country isn't exactly known as a safe place (used to have an extremely high murder rate) so I doubt many will actually move there. BTC to USD trading should be tax free as well but consult a lawyer.

Germany: Tax free for HODLERs that HODL for 1 year minimum. Short term HODLing and trading is taxed.

Malaysia: Tax free for HODLERs (no specific minimum HODLING time). Short term HODLing and trading is taxed.

Malta: No taxes for HODLERs, taxes apply for traders.

Slovenia: No taxes for HODLERS. Trading situation unknown.

These are real people and these are real tragedies. I think, as a community we have to do the best that we can to ensure that we all live a happy life with or without the green that we love so dearly. It is incredibly irresponsible to joke about suicide or even suggest it to people as a joke.

So what can we do to help ourselves?

* Go for a walk (the fresh air can really clear the mind).
* Pick up a new hobby, take some time away from the charts (you deserve it).
* Reach out to someone in here that truly wants to help, some of us have been at the bottom and the top.
* Realise that mistakes are part of the process.
* Understand that money is only money, nothing lasts forever.
* Know that you are loved, you are a son/daughter/brother/husband/friend etc. people love you and no matter how big or small you mess up, this will never change.

It's easy to suggest it's because our leaders are old or stupid or anti-technology, or that these solutions are inherently flawed, open to criminal abuse, fraud and corruption.

There is probably something else at work. It’s probably because cryptocurrencies threaten the governments’ power, and they fear losing control. Threatening positions of power, will always lead to resistance and repercussions.

I cannot hold for more. Having Bachelors degree in Finance, as well as few other certificates, I must inform you about the importance of having financial education before investing in anything, whether its crypto or metals, whether its long-term or short-term. I see people ask about the market orders, about different financial indicators such as Fibbonaci or RSI, give wrong analysis on this whole Evergrande situation and golden cross and etc.. posts such as ""october will be green because historicly it has always been"", nah mate, that does not back up anything, you should not rely on that. You investing real money, do not rely on assumptions, analyse properly. Again, lack of understanding of financial indusrty gives people wrong attitude towards trading. If you know how to boil eggs, doesnt mean you can give advice to a Chef.

Even tho people tend to think that technical analysis does not apply to crypto (that statement itself is so so wrong), it does not mean u can have zero knowledge in finance and succeed. Trading and investing itself is a part of financial industry. In order to control your emotions, to understand the assets behaviour, to correlate different markets and to be prepared for abnormal situations, you MUST have financial education. Im not saying you all must have a degree in finance, and obviously some of you were lucky enought to gain profits without any fin knowledge, but if you are IN, you must be prepared.Do NOT learn from youtubers, do NOT learn from reddit or twitter. Go and read financial books written by professional or watch lectures made by professors. Anything else is just a waste of time. Trading and investing is not like gambling.

This conversation is prompted by the recurring discourse in India since 2017 on the legal status of cryptocurrencies. The Reserve Bank of India, India's central bank, has always held the view that a blanket ban on digital private coins across the country is necessary. As a punishment in case of non-compliance, a draft by the central bank even provides for prison sentences.

However, the climate debate is also drawing positive consequences.

Earlier this year, Elon declared that you can no longer buy Tesla with Bitcoin. Musk justified his decision with the fact that the digital gold does not use sustainable energy during mining.

This resulted in a significant correction in the market. A few months later, the situation on the crypto market has eased worldwide.

One company that may have taken Elon Musk's words to heart is Argo Blockchain. On August 17, Argo announced that it is the world's first publicly traded bitcoin mining company to be climate positive.

**Peter Wall, the Chairman of the Board of Argo said:** ""*We are proud to be the first publicly traded bitcoin mining company to be climate positive and continue to focus on encouraging other companies to join us. In addition, we wanted to make our climate strategy public in hopes of encouraging collaboration, input, and dialogue among all companies to create a climate-positive environment""*

In this case, climate-neutral means that a company measures all its emissions arising from the three scope levels and offsets them. For example, through CO₂ certificates or other measures that mitigate CO₂ emissions. In the case of Argo Blockchain, the company even goes one step further and virtually ""removes"" CO₂ from the atmosphere, thus becoming climate positive.

Argo Blockchain is not the only one trying to mine bitcoin sustainably. Green &amp; clean Bitcoins are increasingly becoming a market advantage to advertise. Because as mining customers are also becoming more aware of sustainability Bitcoins, Bitcoin miners are also seeing this as a market advantage.

I see why a lot of people like to use them and if I'm not mistaken, it is one of the few exchanges our American friends can use.

But it scares me how compliant they are, which sounds weird but hear me out. 

First, they decided not to release the lending program because the SEC bullied and scared them with lawsuits, even though they had everyone's support in the crypto space. It is ultimately their decision but if the SEC can scare them into cancelling this, I can't help but wonder, what else can they get them to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Second, they signed a contract for a financial surveillance software with ICE, the most inhuman agency in the US, in my opinion as an immigrant. They did it for almost no money, a merely $1.36M, it is nothing for a big exchange as Coinbase, so why the hell would they do it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, their customer support is awfully slow for an exchange of their size. I don't like Binance as well but when I was having troubles verifying my information on the exchange, a support agent literally was able to solve it in less than 10m while I had to wait 11d on multiple occasions to receive a response from Coinbase.

Trend Micro researchers said on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency mining malware is now exploiting a recently-disclosed Atlassian Confluence remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which was only made public in August this year. 

Tracked as CVE-2021-26084, the vulnerability impacts Confluence server versions 6.6.0, 6.13.0, 7.4.0, and 7.12.0. 

Issued a CVSS severity score of 9.8, the critical security flaw is an Object-Graph Navigation Language (ONGL) injection vulnerability that can be exploited to trigger RCE -- and is known to be actively exploited in the wild. 

The vulnerability was reported by Benny Jacob through Atlassian's bug bounty program.
z0Miner, a Trojan and cryptocurrency mining bundle, has been updated to exploit the RCE, as well as Oracle's WebLogic Server RCE (CVE-2020-14882) an ElasticSearch RCE (CVE-2015-1427), Jenkins, and other code execution bugs in popular server software.  

Once a vulnerable server has been found and the vulnerability has been used to obtain remote access, the malware will deploy a set of webshells to install and execute malicious files, including a .dll file disguised as a Hyper-V integration service, as well as a scheduled task that pretends to be a legitimate .NET Framework NGEN task.  The task will attempt to download and execute malicious scripts from a repository on Pastebin, but as of now, the URL has been pulled. 

These initial actions are aimed at maintaining persistence on an infected machine. In its second-stage payload deployment, z0Miner will then scan and destroy any competing cryptocurrency miners installed on the server, before launching its own -- a miner that steals computing resources to generate Monero (XMR).

A patch has been released to resolve CVE-2021-26084, and as threat actors will always seek to exploit new bugs for their own ends -- the Microsoft Exchange Server attacks being a prime example -- vulnerable systems should always be updated with new security fixes as quickly as possible by IT administrators.

Well bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is also kinda hailed as the digital gold. It is the most valuable crypto on the market as is it volatile on the other hand you won’t see ethereum described as a digital gold. Ethereum is basically a software platform that the developers use to build other crypto-oriented apps on it and to make use of Ethereum these developers have to buy and pay fees to the network in Ethereum’s native digital currency which is ether.

When u speculate looking at both of them there are similar risks associated with both BTC and Eth, and the potential growth of either is highly speculative even though Eth it has too many uses with decentralised applications and potential to go very much higher.

As the top two cryptos on the market, most experts say both are good options if you are just starting a crypto investment journey. And then others say it’s just as well to split the difference and invest in both.

Personally though I am probably more inclined to invest in Ethereum as it has the highest upside potential of the established cryptocurrencies, given products like NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain… BUT still if given the choice between the two I wouldn’t force the questions of ‘Which one?’ but rather take both.

I am not trying to say one coin is better than the other I was just putting forth my objective view of them both , please do let me know wat u think of them both and which one do you thing fairs better and why …

Because the market needs Cosmos hear me out.

We need Cosmos to achieve main stream adoption and needs some sort of unification. This year when Stargate was launched it was to provide inter-block chain communication which connects the ATOMs  block chain , which is why it earned it's Nick name "" Internet of block chain's"" .

The main purpose for this project is to tackle the interoperability by separating block chain's in such a way that they communicate seamlessly by allowing any block chain to communicate , data sharing and also transact with other block chain's. 

Not only does it act like a bridge and bring unification it also provides a next generation technology stack that's gives developers tools to increase the block chain efficiency.

Cosmos allows different block chains to co exist and have their own uses and also allow block chain's to leverage the capability of other platforms to improve their usage. 

As the network becomes more main stream, it has many projects lined up to be launched which includes the development of inter-chain accounts which would help in securing their digital assets.

So as network becomes more main stream, it's demand will start to increase greatly and they are already being hoarded to use them in Gravity Dex. 

So yes it's now the best time to invest in !

But there’s also a different kind of crypto millionaire—the crypto entrepreneurs who have the necessary business acumen to create world-changing solutions, and Jeremy Gardner is one of them, holding enough coins to be referred to as a crypto millionaire while still being in his 20s.

Jeremy got into crypto when one of his friends offered to purchase him some Bitcoin in exchange for cash back in 2013. It didn’t take a long time for Jeremy to fall in love with Bitcoin and the realization that it allows anyone with an internet connection to exchange value anyone else, removing the need for centralized intermediaries, such as banks or even governments.

Even before Jeremy cashed out some of his Bitcoin investment, he already knew how to spend the money: launch Augur, a decentralized prediction market meant to harness the wisdom of the crowd. After a $5 million ICO, Augur is now live and doing well.

Some people told of genuine reasons to sell like paying off debt, putting a down payment on a house and that’s fantastic, congratulations on achieving your goal.

But no matter the reason everybody that sold made a major mistake that we talk about on this sub all the time. Selling the dip.

If you were happy enough to sell yesterday why weren’t you happy to sell 1 week ago when the price was 20% higher?

Put it this way. If Bitcoin is at 50k and I ask you if you want to sell, you will probably say ‘No’. Then 1 week later it’s at 40k and you sell under the pretense that you’re happy with your trade then I just don’t understand your logic.

If you weren’t happy selling at 50k, why are you happy selling at 40k?

So I have a question for anybody who sold.

What was the reason you sold? I suspect fear from Reddit’s echo chamber to be among the reasons.

And do you regret selling? Have you bought back in?

Will you buy back in if the bull run appears to be continuing?

Some people may be thinking ‘Yes’ to that last question in which case you haven’t learned from your mistake and are repeating it over again. If you’re not happy about buying your crypto of choice now, why will you be happy buying at when it’s 30% more valuable?

In an interview with the Washington Post, Gensler said that stablecoins behave like poker chips in the casino. He then called on lawmakers to give the SEC more authority to regulate the industry. From what he said, it is clear that the regulation Gensler wants will not be crypto-friendly as many had hoped when he was appointed.

Woods of Ark Investments had an excellent interview on the Bankless podcast on September 13th. It was really exciting. She gave the opinion that we are on the threshold of an explosion of innovation and crypto is symptomatic of it. 

She stated “The seeds for what is about to happen were planted in the twenty years that ended with the tech and telecom bubble and are now beginning to blossom. We think there are five major platforms and fourteen different technologies that are all getting ready to move into the sweet spot of their S curves, and there are going to be convergences between and among these technologies creating explosive growth. In the crypto space we’re going to see blockchain technology and artificial intelligence converge and create explosive reaction.” 

She didn’t specify what those five major platforms and fourteen different technologies are exactly. At first, I assumed she was referring to five major blockchain layer one platforms like Bitcoin, Eth, HBAR (Hashgraph), Ada, ICP, VeChain, Sol (choose your favorite, I’m just giving examples). I wanted to know what they were, but she didn’t say on the podcast, so I browsed Ark’s website and found this:

“ARK believes innovations centered around artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, DNA sequencing, and blockchain technology will change the way the world works and deliver outsized growth as industries transform.”

So it turns out she wasn’t referring to five major blockchain platforms, just that blockchain tech in general is one of those five major platforms getting ready to move into the sweet spot of their S Curve, along with AI, robotics, energy storage, and DNA sequencing. 

In the Bankless Podcast she went on to say: “The productive uplift of these major platforms is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Only once before have we seen multiple major platforms evolve like this at the same time and that was in the early 1900s - telephone, automobile, and electricity, and that was the tech innovation of its time that transformed our world.
In 2019 we evaluated the market cap around the world associated with truly transformative innovation. That year it was seven trillion dollars - less than 10% of the global public equity market cap. Last year it doubled to fourteen trillion. We believe in the next five to ten years it will be north of $100 trillion dollars.”

Imagine if crypto’s global market cap increased proportionally. It’s currently at $2 trillion. For simplicities sake, if we assume that $100 trillion predicted figure is split evenly among these five major platforms - one of which is blockchain tech - then that pushes the global crypto market cap to $20 trillion in 5-10 years, from its current value of $2 trillion. Its market cap was only $200 billion in 2019, so maybe $20 trillion in 5-10 years is a low ball figure for global crypto market cap? Big growth.

Like the title says. That’s the million dollar question of this post. I know Shib was not at all popular on this sub. Hell, when I think about it…. Shib has been trashed on here six ways to Sunday. Now, I’m not suggesting that anyone was wrong for trashing Shib. I’m sure many have their reasons, just as much as I’m sure others only trashed it because they heard someone else trash it. I’ve been holding Shib for several months now and am still not 100%. But that’s me though. 

Anyway, I’m curious if sentiment has changed at all since it’s now on bigger platforms like CB? How many of the hard liners who trashed Shib are now holding some? My guess, is there are a bunch on here holding quietly. The fact that Shib is #24 in popularity on Coinbase after only a week of being listed there makes me believe my suspicion is probably right.

I had a post about this yesterday but I lacked linked proof so it got taken down after a few hundred upvotes. Here is [proof](https://imgur.com/a/wPeZhEG) that I loaded up my bags, I’ve been working towards 1 whole ETH!

Anyways, to my point:

If there is one lesson I have learned from my time in this sub, it’s that *no one knows shit about fuck.*

When I see posts about golden crosses or death crosses I just keep scrolling. Technically analyze my ass! Every single time people say the market will go up, it goes down or crabs, and every single time people say the market will go down, it goes up or crabs. 

I know people said the Evergrande situation would have some impact on things, but when people expect the market to definitively go one way, they’re always wrong. Trying to time the market has never worked for me personally, in fact, taking cues from this sub lost me the most money! (Don’t worry, I still love you guys &lt;3)

All I’m saying is that when someone says that something is gonna go up, the opposite is about to occur. When someone says something is gonna go down, ignore it. 

Dudes will be spamming this sub about golden crosses while clocking into the Golden Arches. I can’t say it enough, anyone here who claims to know what the hell is going on is kidding themselves.

Do not listen to people on Reddit about what to do with *your* money.

know. I know. Fuck Robinhood.

But I think Robinhood giving people access to their wallets is good, leads to more proper adoption of crypto utilization, and will contribute to making using crypto wallets mainstream.

There are hundreds of thousands if not millions of users on Robinhood who own crypto. Many of whom probably have not moved their crypto to hard wallets or other exchanges, or have been able to utilize crypto the way it was Intended.

This is either because they haven't been able to due to the lack of access to their wallet; or because they didn't want to have to sell their crypto, have it count as a taxable event, transfer the fiat over to their bank, wait for that to clear, transfer it from a bank to a crypto exchange, wait for that to clear, then finally be able to buy their crypto.

I'm all for people having access to their crypto even if it is on a platform people may or may not like.

Many people have used Robinhood as a stepping stone to get into crypto because let's be honest crypto is not easy for the average person to get into. Some people have straight up never been exposed to crypto until Robinhood. 

Overall I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Which right now I can't think of any.

However, with doing this, once they gain some level of mass adoption, I feel like the chain and products are going to be WAY less clunky than other chains and way more attractive with simple features for retail users. It seems that it is already more in touch with a “retail level” platform and ease of use. I’ve used Osmosis, Emeris, Terrastation, Cosmostation and Keplr wallet. As someone who is not a computer smart, these platforms are all pretty easy to use and operate! Idk, I am pretty hyped up on Cosmos and Mt. Dew rn, so I’m alittle excitable

EDIT: One I know I haven’t tried Bluzelle and there are probably way more I haven’t tried. But the point is, from what I’ve used, ease of use has been impressive.

EDIT 2: I never got to my unpopular part. I believe ATOM has potential to be the dominant Defi blockchain, ahead of ETH if things go right and it catches a ton of mainstream retailers coming for Defi. ETH has a serious scaling problem and I can see Defi moving to Cosmos, rather than wait to see if ETH can scale in the next few years. THIS WILL NOT KILL ETH.

We're currently at the halfway point between the last moon distribution and the next one. In this time of longing, we could all use an injection of pure, uncut hopium. Here's a quick rundown on what your life will be like in 10 years based on how many moons you have.

**0 MOONS:**

Wh-what happened? You didn't save a single moon? I guess it's been a rough decade. Good luck friend.

**10 MOONS:**

You've got a small amount saved for emergencies. If you have a minor financial emergency, like a necessary car repair you always have the option of cashing out your moons. IT's nice to have a small reserve.

**100 MOONS:**

You could go on a vacation with your family with your moon savings! May I suggest Universal Studios in Florida? They have Simpsons world AND Harry Potter world!

**1,000 MOONS**

Starting to get to life changing money here! You can use this as your child's college education fund. Just make sure they take some business classes on crypto. Have to preserve the family tradition.

**10,000 MOONS**

Not quite retirement money, but getting closer! If you need to take a year off and figure things out and re-evaluate your career, you can take some profits and do that. You have options and can make choices about what you WANT to do.

**100,000 MOONS**

Whale alert! You are officially rich! You no longer have to work for the rest of your life. Hopefully you do something meaningful with your life. If not, make sure to waste your life doing something you love. If that's watching Star Trek and drinking Sunkist, enjoy the hell out of it!

Yesterday was my first post on Reddit on the Evergrande Fiasco and many people told me to post here daily. Here goes post #2!

Today: We’ll find out in a few hours if Evergrande does indeed pay its USD interest obligation; I’m leaning for it to trigger its 30-day grace period and potentially ghosting the media entirely (remember folks, this still doesn’t signal the end of the world).

Digressing back to the write-up, today’s piece focuses on 3 topical subjects, relating to: Central Bank (CB) decisions / Crypto Regulations / ending with my usual technical analysis (TA). Let’s get to it:

**1.** Yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) confirmed it would stick to its ultra-easy monetary policy (maintaining its target for short-term interest rates at -0.1% + its target for the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield at practically zero). The Fed was next, holding on to its decision to not cut / taper yet. Immediately, the Crypto market reacted positively, glorifying its decision to “keep printing.” \[brrrrr\]… Looking deeper into the dot plot though, two members changed their forecast nearer with half the committee now forecasting an increase in 2022.

IMO, I’m surprised to see how well the market reacted… The FOMC has always been a game of expectation, and Powell disappointed in my books - Prior to this morning’s FOMC, expectation was for the first hike / taper to be in Oct/Nov 2022. He’s now pushed it forward to a target of mid-2022. In theory, for the Fed to stop its current QE pace of US$80bn/month, that would mean a US$10bn/month reduction vs the US$10bn/meeting expectation. The fact that he also provided a precise expectation gauge vs his previous casual remarks also bring us one step closer to the end of the printing party. That said, the market reaction was actually right long-term (even though they’re thinking short-term), as I’m doubtful that things would be as rosy in the months leading to mid-2022.

**2.** WSJ headlined today “SEC’s Gensler Doesn’t See Cryptocurrencies Lasting Long.” This was taken from his online interview with the Washington Post yesterday. The only thing I saw in the interview that could lead to such a conclusion was when Mr Gensler remarked, “I don’t think there’s long-term viability for five or six thousand private forms of money” \[speaking on stablecoins\]. One can only shake their heads for someone so skilled to magically conjure such a heading…

Anyways, Biden tapped Omarova to head the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). For our purposes, the primary role of the OCC is to: “(A). to ensure the safety and soundness of the national banking system; (B). to foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services; (C). to ensure fair and equal access to financial services to all Americans; (D). to enforce anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism finance laws; and to (E). investigate misconduct committed by institution-affiliated parties.” Apparently, Omarova is a Crypto critic, who would spell trouble given her key power to approve / deny applications for new charters, branches, capital, and changes in the banking structure. That said, I would hold off on judging her until we hear her speak at the very least (I myself used to be a critic but flipped rather quickly). Interestingly, if we were to re-read the key roles of the OCC, DeFi is clearly the best solution to (B), (C), (E).

**3.** Finally… Volatility is the name of the game come tomorrow (Sept 24), with $2.8bn of BTC and $1.4bn of ETH options expiring, the highest volume since May 17 (same date when its price collapsed from $43k to $30k). Downside protection is still in-demand as 1-week 25d skew continue to lie on the high end of \~15% (avg. 4%). The current max pain price is at $44k, but shorts are still protected considering current price levels. On-chain metrics show little change at present, with exchange outflows and miner flows dipping back down during this reversal from $40k to $43k. MVRV ratios for BTC and ETH have also creeped back down to the 2.0 range, around the same as late May. This gauge to some look like a healthy consolidation.

**Namecoin** had a niche objective it was trying to drive around storing data on the blockchain, with it's flagship proposal being an alternative to DNS.

You can see it's price history here: 
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/namecoin/


2013 bull run it got up to 12 dollars

2017 bull run it got up to 7 dollars

2020 bull run so far it has hit 3 dollars

This is what's called a degenerator, and it's what a majority of Alts are. Previous bull run buyers will have a few coins like this. This link discusses what that theory is in detail.

https://woobull.com/the-two-types-of-altcoins-an-investors-view/

The fact is this is a speculative market, that gets manic in a bull run. You only need to look as far as Safemoon and Shib to know how incorrectly value is assigned. So once the hype dies down so does the price action.

So it's critical that you look into the fundamentals of the project but also it's relevance outside of crypto with regards to its objective it is trying to achieve.

State-owned enterprises will underpin the restructure, effectively transforming the property developer into a state-owned enterprise.

“The deal is being designed to protect Chinese nationals who have bought apartments from Evergrande, like the ones you see protesting on the streets and also those who have invested in Evergrande’s wealth management products,” the source said.

“But the big thing is stemming any widespread economic flow-on effects that insolvency would cause on the China economy.”

Talk of a Government-led restructure comes as the Thursday (September 23) deadline looms for a $83.5 million interest payment on a 5-year, USD denominated Evergrande bond. The bond’s initial issue size was around $2 billion.

The bond’s covenants have a 30-day period before a missed payment is considered a default.

On the same day, Evergrande also has to pay a $35.8 million coupon payment for a Shenzhen-traded 5.8% Sept 2025 bond. The company’s Hengda Real Estate unit has today said it will make that payment, but not word thus far on the USD bond commitments.

Another multi-million dollar interest payment on a 7-year USD bond is due the following week.

Those exposed to Evergrande’s USD bonds and Evergrande shareholders are likely to be hardest hit by the China Evergrande deal.

This is simply meant to provide useful information into the Decentralization of each one. 

Let’s start with the number of validators for ETH, ADA, DOT and NANO.

ETH: **217,358**

ADA: **2076**

DOT: **297**

NANO: **108**

So ETH seems to be doing amazing here, ADA is okay, but DOT and NANO are absolutely horrible in terms of how many different validators they have. These blockchains may be fast, but holy shit are they ever centralized.

Now for ETH and ADA, let’s take a look at the number of parties required to take 51% stake of the network.

For ETH, **12 Entities control 34% of staked Ether.** It is difficult to estimate a 51% stake from this but the number should be much higher than 12.

For ADA, **23 Pool operators control 50.05% of the network.** 

From these statistics we can see that ETH is more decentralized than ADA, in both the number of nodes and the amount of nodes required to attack the network. However, neither of them are as decentralized as I had previously thought.

I hope this information was helpful!

This gives the Algorand defi community access to a magnitude of more talent and I believe is why DeFi on Algorand is about to explode. Yieldly, Tinyman, Opulous, Algodex.

The presumed dump was set to occur last night 9/22/21 at 9:30 PM EST after a 2 day hiatus in the Chinese markets. Obviously, as many more experienced investors suspected, this was just FUD being propagated by traders shorting the market and retail investors who were worried and panicking.

Well, the cryptocurrency market has only appreciated in value since last night and just 24 hours after the supposed FUD was meant to cause a Black Swan event, [Evergrande's stock just pumped 15%](https://i.imgur.com/iykhllg.png).

This wallet has received a total of 46.8B Dogecoin and sent a total of 7.15B Dogecoin. Leaving it a total supply of 36.7B Dogecoin, roughly 28% of the current supply.

\------------------------

**Why it matters:** 

To many people looking at Dogecoin one wallet that holds 28% of the current supply sounds like a rug pull waiting to happen.

The surprising thing about this hypothesis is that the wallet hasn't sent any crypto since 04/12/2021 when the price was $.0707 meaning it didn't cash out on the SNL hype or the buildup leading up to it, or the subsequent crash or even now it could sell it's Doge for a 300% increase yet it hasn't moved.

There is also reason to believe that the sends might also have to do with RH sending crypto to alternate wallets and not actual *sales*. (more on this later)

\-----------------------

**What we know:** 

Rh began offering Dogecoin trading to it's customers in July 2018 and this wallet first began amassing a stockpile of Dogecoin in February of 2019. [This isn't the first time that this wallet has been associated with speculation that it was under RH's control](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508). Back in May RH responded to the assumptions that it was RH - with the response ""We don't have significant positions in any of the coins that we keep"".

Please note the word \*we\* as in RH. Meaning that statement could be completely accurate but that doesn't mean RH doesn't hold a significant amount of coins that their users own. If we look at the ""[RH Cryptocurrency Security FAQ](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cryptocurrency-security/), they acknowledge that they store the coins of their users mainly in cold storage disconnected from the Internet with other coins kept in hot storage to facilitate day-to-day operations.

Meaning that if this wallet does in fact belong to RH it is likely a cold storage wallet and there is another wallet with a portion of that 7.15B doge that was sent from this address that RH uses for it's day-to-day trading operations.

\------------------------

**How much USD actually gets traded on RH for Dogecoin --- and is it feasible that RH owns 8.1B USD of dogecoin in Cold Storage with more elsewhere?**

If we look at the Q2 revenue information from RH crypto, [we know 41% of RH revenue came from crypto trading with 62% of that coming from Dogecoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/robinhood-crypto-revenue-jumped-over-45-fold-in-q2-to-233-million.html). In other words 25% of RH total revenue came from Dogecoin trades in Q2.

**Regarding numbers**

RH made 233M in crypto trading Q2, 62% of that is 144.46M worth of Dogecoin trades.

RH has a sliding fee determined by the underlying price of dogecoin- where the fee to trade crypto equals out to about 00.25% per party per trade or .00.50% for both parties per trade (meaning half comes from the buyer and half comes from the seller).

Knowing the % of charged fees for every transaction and the amount of fees collected we can calculate roughly how many dollars were traded in Dogecoin in Q2. (Please note this is a rough estimate as we do not know what percent of the fee is pocketed by RH and considered revenue.)

**Getting to the total amount of USD traded in Q2 for Dogecoin**

Assuming RH collects the full 00.25% of the fee per trade there was a total USD value of $57,784,000,000 worth of buys/sells on RH. Knowing every buy has to have a sell we use the 00.50% fee to calculate the total number of trades to roughly $28,892,000,000 worth of dogecoin was exchanged considering both the buy/sell fee.

So assuming RH pockets the full amount of the fee and doesn't use or pay any to cover operating expenses related to crypto trading there was 28.89B worth of Dogecoin traded in Q2. Knowing that they probably don't pocket the full amount - it likely makes this number an underestimate.

**Shortcomings in the numbers above**

Knowing roughly $28.89B worth of Dogecoin trades occurred in Q2 for RH -- doesn't tell us how many unique coins are being held by their users, and many of this $28.89B worth of trades could be accounted for entirely by day traders making individual trades, it is not indicative of total amount being held in Dogecoin and there is no way to get that number from this information.

All I can say for sure is the number 1 Dogecoin wallet currently holds  8.1B worth of Dogecoin and began collecting it in Q1 of 2019. It seems within reason to assume RH has enough Dogecoin volume given 2.5 years that they could have amassed a collection of Dogecoin currently equal to 8.1B for its userbase (in cold storage) and has an undisclosed amount more located elsewhere.

\-----------------------------

**The Takeaway**

Dogecoin currently has a problem with its supply being centralized to a handful of wallets and without the wallet owners coming forward to identify themselves it is not entirely clear who owns how much and how much is centralized in a few hands verses held by platforms/exchanges. There are many platforms that trade IOU's for crypto that could account for some of these wallets such as Robinhood, Etorro, Webull, etc.. but again there is no way to know who owns how much.

Given what we've reviewed it's completely within reason to believe that RH holds 28% of the Dogecoin supply for its users - especially considering the price back in 2019 was a mere fraction of what it is now.

With RH providing wallets to its users, I \*think\* more information will be revealed in the coming days to the details of the #1 Dogecoin wallet.

\--------------------------------

**One final note** \- It is heavily speculated that Robinhood trades IOU's off exchange when it is able to, in order to cut back on operating costs and increase total profit - this would not provide any evidence of transaction (this is relevant to the TLDR).

\---------------------------------

**TLDR** \- We will soon find out if the #1 dogecoin wallet belongs to RH via it's userbase - If true a number of the Dogecoin in existence that can not be traded/used for any type of adoption ([meaning it has no transactions as pointed out in another top cryptocurrency thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pt3dl0/there_isnt_doge_adoption_the_opposite_is/)) will become available for use.

Unfortunately I dropped in late to the NFT discussion and don't know what was discussed and what was not discussed. I apologize if this was answered.

 I try and spend my energy looking for things that have real world millions or billions of dollars behind them that crypto currency can transform.

 One of the things I'm looking for in the NFT space is a DAO Media company.  Are there any known yet?


 Currently we have these multi billion dollar media companies, that own everything from music to movies, to television shows to art.

 And they license these things out but the current model places limits to who can do so.

 It's theoretically possible using smart contracts or block chains,  for a DAObto set up all of their media, to be licensed across many different scales.

 From wanting to rent Is a movie at home,  Or a small business license it for a public showing,  Or a large network to license it for a larger distribution network,  To a YouTube or using 10 seconds of copyrighted media in their productions that isn't fair use.

 There is the potential for a DAO to revolutionize and mass capitalize, media ownership and licensing in the future.

It's almost a common sense here that you should buy crypto and never sell it. However, not always this is the best strategy and I'll show why:

[Top 20 coins in September 25th, 2016](https://preview.redd.it/7l97zafyh5p71.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6543703616a5314d6a6959edba005ac40e45e104)

There were many coins that never got recovered from the 2017 bear market: MaidSafeCoin, Steem, Emercoin, Counterparty, Bitshares...

Others are currently out of the top 20: Stellar, Monero, Dash.

&amp;#x200B;

[Top 20 coins at September 19th, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w91b86mfi5p71.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77447dc287bab301aa44daf213b59770f97333d3)

As you can see, only 5 top coins in 2016 remains at the top 20, or 25%: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, XRP.

The point is: The strategy of holding Altcoins for too much time may not be the best choice. It's important to keep realistic goals and always revaluate the coins in your portfolio after reaching those goals. 

Many good altcoins probably will not survive the next real bear market, so it's very important to know when to buy and when to sell.

I'm a common guy and it's not financial advice. However, the past data show us that diversify between coins and between other assets is the best way to survive this amazing world of crypto.

Decentralization is the most interesting part of the trilemma (security, scalability) to me.

Factors include:

How are blocks authenticated? Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake. I naively see PoW as more decentralized, less scalable due to incentivizing competition. Proof of Stake seems more cooperative in most implementations thus more scalable and less energy intensive but pools grow larger or just split and grow in the same hand which could lead to centralizing over time. It requires a large number of the coin to be held, vs PoW requiring primarily competitive hardware.

How were the coins distributed?
If a small number kept control over a large amount of coins this seems to favor scalability (they could use it to grow the coin in a controlled manner) over decentralization.

How many nodes?
More nodes means (generally) the chain is in more separate hands, more people are participating in rewards.

Where are the nodes?
Nodes being distributed across different countries and regions aids in long term decentralization.

I’m not trying to put any above others, they all make trade offs and have strengths. Here are some comparisons on top coins (sorry if yours not here, just a sample prejudiced by what I read a lot):

BTC: PoW, 13.5k nodes reported at high, 11,400 active now, none needed to validate as far as I can tell

ETH: PoW moving to PoS, 8k nodes claimed at high, ~3.4K now, 32 ETH ~$100k)

DOGE: PoW, ~1k reported, none needed to validate

ADA: PoS, 3-4K pools/nodes, at least 505 ADA ($1.1k)

ALGO: PoS, over 100 nodes, it seems there are two different categories of nodes, no one can join the main network of consensus nodes at this time, can make a node that doesn’t earn anything with minimal coins

SOL: PoS, around 200 nodes, also multiple categories of nodes, there is very small coin minimum to run a validation node that earns rewards based on number of coins staked.

I said nothing about security because I’m ignorant. Please teach me how I’m wrong, add info about the many coins I didn’t get to, and give your take on decentralization in crypto.

They now only allow you to use ACH Transfers, which require your bank account info to initially be reviewed for to 3-5 business days and then you can request the wire. That seems like a lot of down time in the market for a card that used to work immediately.

They said all of this is because they've had an increase in Fraud reports occuring from this specific merchant and there is no way to bypass the ""security measures for your account"", even if specifically requesting to do so. I've started the process of linking my accounts for the ACH Transfer, but I feel like that gives the merchant even more details about my bank account so I don't see how it helps Chase's claim it's  anti-fraud security measures.

I followed the QAnon conspiracy closely, not as a believer or participant, but just to see how nuts these people really are.

I think it would be interesting to see how many SafeMoon people that post the nonsense they do also follow QAnon and believe it in all. I’ve heard many similar things, such as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history,” said by both camps.

I don’t think it’s a majority of Safemoon hodlers, but it’s a big enough chunk for me to make the correlation. 

If you don’t believe me, read some of the absolute dog crap that’s posted over there. I’ve done my best to call it out, but just like the Qoomers, those that are die-hard rabbit hole SafeMooners cannot be reasoned with.

Now, I’m not slamming all safemooners. Some are brand new to crypto like I was when I bought it as my first “real” crypto in March. Some are serious investors. There are some great memes and a lot of energy over there. They truly love this token and the dev team. A lot are die-hard safemooners like I was until all the questionable activity started happening that this very sub warned about and mapped out almost to a T. 

I won’t sell mine. Ever. Even if it is worth 5% of my initial buy in because I will always keep my very first investment.

In February I bought 10 random alt coins from the 25 to 100 rank based on market cap, evenly split over my initial investment.

Things looked pretty good overall until the May crash. I HODLed on and 8 of them have never recovered to my original buy price at any point since then. Several are down 50% to 60% right now and overall it’s a 40% loss on the full bag (two actually did quite well and tripled in price before I took some profits).

I expect them to recover somewhat from today of course, but I’ve been patiently waiting for them to just break even so I can abandon ship, which up till now has not even remotely come close.

Not sure if I’ll continue to hold until break even or just limit my losses during the next pump, but wanted to warn folks that think gains are inevitable when gambling with low cap alts.

The cryptos I bought in the top 20 have fared much better overall and I’ve made enough profit to cover my losses on the smaller alts. Going forward I’m sticking to the top of the market cap chart. Lower potential rewards I suppose, but more tolerable risk.

The same shit people talked about internet 
and mobile phones. I am just 22 years old and from europe, but even I remember it. 

""Why would I need mobile phone? (my dad asked uncle when I was 5/6 years old), it is stupid gadget, we have already phone at home."" My uncle had mobile phone because he worked in New York, in some american company, after 3/4 years he get new one, so he give old one to my dad. Dad wasn't happy but started to use it, cause it was free. Phones weren't too popular then. Most neighbours told this was waste of money. My first phone I had when I was 10/11. I used it rarely, calls were expensive, internet even more. I also thought it is useless gadget, that can be used only to call parents or do photos.

""Internet is  temporary toy and will have no impact  for the world"", most people liked to tell. For most people it was  another useless thing for teenagers that sat whole  days in front of the computer. When I had computer lessons in primary school we used internet only to play famous then internet games. Even economy nobel prize winner in 1998 Paul Kruegman believed internet will end like fax machines and slowly die until 2005.  

Don't you see simillarities of those situations with crypto today? History is repeating. Many people smashed internet 20 years ago, and instead of learning a lesson they repeat the same mistake again. A lot of people, even many of us still can't see full potential of crypto.

Even people like warren buffet say it. Billionaire Warren Buffett is one of the most respected investors in history, thanks to a track record that's seen him regularly make stellar returns over several decades.

Buffett would seem to be exactly the type of expert you should look to for investing tips. But when he was asked to name some of the biggest investing mistakes he sees people make, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" recently told Yahoo Finance that anyone looking for investment advice should ""never listen to people like me."" People and news stations like CNBC who know jack shit about CRYPTOCURRENCY.

Like the Cramer show on cnbc is financial ENTERTAINMENT. THATS IT. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
If you ever tune in to CNBC’s popular Mad Money show, you’ll notice that host Jim Cramer speaks about the financial markets with unabashed certainty. Behind the goofy sound effects and the onscreen antics lies his particular brand of stock market punditry.

Cramer’s energy and confidence are most evident in the lightning round where his devotees hail “Booyah” and ask for his take on a barrage of stocks. In response, Cramer presents quick statistics and declares, “Same-store sales in China rose 12% last quarter. It’s a screaming buy; they’re doing great. BUY! BUY! BUY!” Or, he blurts out, “This company is involved with deep water rigs, the deep water market has not come back at all. If it does go up at all, SELL, SELL, SELL!”

What’s most notable about Mad Money is that Cramer is seemingly equipped to answer questions about any listed company with all the gusto he can muster. How could he possibly know the ins and outs of every company: their products, finances, cash flow, competitive positions, market prospects, and current valuation? He may know of many companies cursorily, but how could he have intimate knowledge of every ticker symbol that his fans throw at him? You’ll never hear him say, “Sorry, never heard of them,” or “Gee … truth be told, I’m not familiar with their new products or how they compare to the competitor’s products. I really couldn’t tell you.” He’s loud. He’s boisterous. And, he’s got to have an opinion on every stock—if he doesn’t, there is no show. He doesn't give sound advice to where you should invest your money and that is why you should not listen to jokers like him.

First off, if you’re purely long term hodling, this probably isn’t really going to be all that relevant to you. You’re welcome to keep reading, but I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. Of course making short term moves is riskier, but if you try it responsibly with a tiny portion of your portfolio and find that you end up doing better than if you’d done nothing but held your bags in a certain time frame, I think making short term moves with a small portion of your crypto can be an extremely valuable tool to grow your bags.

I’m not going to pretend I’m a crypto OG at all, but I’d like to share a bit in the hopes that it can help someone even newer than I am. So I made my first crypto buy at the beginning of last November. I think an issue anyone who got in around the 2nd half of 2020 (or at the beginning of any huge multi-month rally) had to contend with was being spoiled by profits from the get go. 

It legit felt like I’d stumbled on a gold mine, iirc there wasn’t even a relatively small correction until about January. So as a result, one of the biggest mistakes I made early on was not taking as much profit as I would have liked to I hindsight, partially because of course I thought it would keep going, but partially because I hadn’t yet taken the time to think about how I’d be taking profits at all. I think a lot of people are in that exact same boat. I didn’t panic sell, but after BTC was down to ~55k from 64k, that’s when the line between panic selling and taking profits started getting blurry. Therefore, at least for me it’s a lot easier to take profits on the way up instead. 

But how exactly to take said profits can be tricky. On both extreme ends of the spectrum, you don’t want to sell most or all of your bags when you can’t know whether or not the price will keep running, but you don’t want to take 0 profits and just watch your bags tank with the next market crash either. 

Firstly, no matter what I’m doing, I don’t make big moves with a huge piece of my portfolio. That way I don’t have to bet the farm on being absolutely perfect with every buy or sell. If you’re only making small moves, you don’t need to be 100% right, just vaguely right more than half of the time. You might not be able to call a top, but if you can get at least a few sells within at least 20% of it, I think most of us would consider that a fine consolation.

There are also different strategies I use depending on the general place I think the market is. Trying to call the top is a waste of time and energy, but we can all tell with at least moderate accuracy whether the market’s in a strong uptrend, or whether it’s looking like a possible or even probable plateau. (Note: pretty much any profit taking strategy will require keeping track of your buys so that you can know when to take profits, keeping all that in your head would be absolutely insane). 

Generally in a bull run, the baseline strategy I use is waiting until the thing I want to sell is 20-30% up, at which point I’ll sell about 5%, and then from there I’ll sell 2% more every time the price increases another 10%. This allows me to lock in some profit so that I have the opportunity to buy back in case of a 20+% correction, but it doesn’t deplete my bag to the point that it hinders its growth in the case of the price continuing up. And if the crash never happens and you don’t get that opportunity to buy back, hey, nothing wrong with taking a little profits off the table entirely. 

In cases like these last few days though, of course I eased into buying the dip, if it dips more I’ll buy increasingly aggressively so that my average price is going to be closer to the lowest buy than the middle, but now since there’s a lot of uncertainty in the market, I’ve shifted my profit taking strategy from what I’d do in a strong bull trend, to tightening up my profit taking and starting much earlier. I might only wait until a buy I made yesterday is 15-20% up, and I might take closer to 10% or more at a time.

If the rally keeps going, I’ll shift my strategy back again and I’ll still have 50-70% of the buys I made in the last couple days, but since (at least to me) it seems like a strong possibility of at least going back to where it was yesterday if not further, my goal here is to take enough profits in the short term to end up with more USD/USDC than I had before I started buying this recent dip. If I’m unable to do this and the crash turns into another May situation, I’m perfectly happy with the buys I made in the last couple days even if the price absolutely tanks. 

Absolute worst case the bull cycle’s 100% confirmed over, the vast majority of my portfolio is in blue chip top 15 coins, so I’ll just consider those buys long term investments for the next cycle in 2024. I think that’s the sensible back up plan most of us have for any moves we’re making right now. If holding for 4 years will make even someone who bought the last peak profitable, I’ll be significantly more profitable buying 30+% below the peak. 

Definitely don’t just copy/paste what I’m doing for yourself though, I tweak my own numbers all the time based on how I’m feeling about where market sentiment and price action are. I just wanted to give sort of an overview of how I like to take profits in different situations to illustrate one of the infinite number of ways to do it, and to give an idea that hopefully someone who hasn’t formed a profit taking plan yet can be inspired to create their own system. 

But I think it’s absolutely necessary to have *some* plan (unless like I said at the beginning, your plan is purely long term hodling). Your profit taking plan will almost definitely change in different situations, but it’s good to have a strategic foundation to build off of. You really don’t want to be just winging it at the most pivotal moments of a cycle, that’s for sure. 

I think that’s about it, I’d appreciate hearing any thoughts and/or your own strategy for taking profits too. We all know at this point that just blindly taking the advice of some guy online is extremely dumb, but the value of places like this is that we can share ideas, run them through our own respective filters, tweak them a little bit, and maybe come across some cool ideas that we wouldn’t have thought of on our own. Again, as long as you aren’t just copying something someone else is doing without understanding why they’re doing it, I think forums like this can really help people sharpen their strategy and be more successful in investing and trading in this space.

Some scams to watch out for.

*malware spies on your copy-and-paste
*Fake Wallets
*Crypto scams on Twitter
*Fraudulent airdrops
*Celebrity impersonations


This first scam happened to me. Luckily I spotted the change before I sent the crypto.

Nasty crypto malware spies on your copy-and-paste — how to protect yourself

The Trojan monitors clipboard activity to detect if it contains the account address of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It tampers with the receiving address to its own address to redirect the cryptocurrency to its own wallet.

Cryptocurrency scams and phishing attacks are getting out of hand. Malicious actors are masquerading as representatives of trusted cryptocurrency apps such as Atomic Wallet and Trust Wallet, and phishing for users' private keys and other personal information to steal cryptocurrency.

The most recent crypto scam to make national headlines led to $2 million in losses. According to the FTC, perpetrators pretended to be Tesla CEO Elon Musk and urged unsuspecting victims to send their cryptocurrencies to a wallet. They were given false promises that their digital assets would grow exponentially. Unfortunately, the scammer zipped away with the victims' digital assets.

Crypto scams on Twitter: Fraudulent help forms and AirDrops

Celebrity impersonations aren't the only way crypto scammers steal victims' digital assets. I've spotted a handful of alarming and disquieting scams spreading like wildfire across the internet.

Under several tweets asking for guidance on how to complete altcoin transactions, scammers replied with links to bogus help forms that look like they're from trusted, popular cryptocurrency apps such as Atomic Wallet and Trust Wallet.

Finally, I've seen many airdrop scams. When founders launch a new cryptocurrency, many people offer to give away a nice chunk of their token supply as a marketing ploy. This is called an airdrop. Some airdrops are legitimate. Authentic airdrops will only ask for our public wallet address, which can be shared with others.

Fraudulent airdrops, however, will ask you to give up your private keys. A private key is an encrypted alphanumeric code — a string of letters and numbers — that permits access to your cryptocurrency holdings. Of course, airdrops don't require such personal information; all the founders need is your public wallet address.

Once you give up this sensitive information to scammers, whether it's your private keys or your seed phrase, your account will be wiped and you won't be able to recover any of your assets.

How to protect yourself from cryptocurrency scams

It goes without saying that you should never, ever — not even if there's a fire — give up your seed phrase or private keys. Most cryptocurrency apps warn first-time users that they should write down and safeguard their seed phrase because if they lose it, they won't be able to recover it.

""DO NOT share this phrase with anyone! These words can be used to steal all your accounts. You can't edit/change your Seed Phrase / Secret Recovery Phrase,"" Metamask, a crypto wallet, warned on its support page.

Secondly, if you're a cryptocurrency holder, it's in your best interest to take your digital assets off online exchanges and transfer them into a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S, a USB device that stores your precious digital assets. If Atomic Wallet, Coinbase or Metamask gets hacked, you won't fret because all of your cryptocurrencies are stored away in a safe hardware wallet.

Whether you decide to join the craze or sit back and watch the rollercoaster’s dips and turns, here are a few cyber security tips that will be wise to follow:

Research before investing to make sure your cryptocurrency website is well secured and trustworthy.Do not trust Twitter or other social media for investment advice since fake news is a pitfall.Think before you click! Do not fall for phishing scams or ads laced with malicious links.Report phishing scams, and don’t share or forward the lure to others.Closely monitor your cryptocurrency wallets, credit card accounts, and banking accounts.Be wary of social engineering attempts to steal your credentials.Routinely scan your computers, laptops, mobile phones, and other devices using updated and patched antivirus/anti-malware software.Avoid using two-factor authentication via SMStexts, rather use Google Auth.

 If this information saves one person from being scammed it was 100% worth the time to post.

Finally,  I would suggest using a dedicated device solely for the use of crypto. 

Be smart, stay safe and enjoy the crypto space.

There’s also the popular narrative that you must do extensive DD before picking a project. 

However, something I don’t see on here is how we dumb people invest in Crypto. You heard that right, charts and endless intricate discussions confuse my brain and I don’t like them. So I thought I would make a quick guide for people like me. 

First things first, “death crosses” or “Golden arches” or whenever they are called is straight up bs (in my opinion) so skip that altogether. 

Anyway, here are the steps. 

Strategy level: Safe

• Go to CoinGeko and choose any project in the top 20. Check it’s logo, how many followers they have on Twitter and invest. Make sure it is currently way below it’s ATH to maximise future profits. That should take about 5 minutes. 

After that close your computer and go hang out with your GF or mom or do something outside. 

I am dead serious, this is how I invest and it hasn’t let me down. My rationale behind this is that Crypto is only 12 years old, that means whatever decision I make now is almost guaranteed to turn out well. Oh, and I don’t believe in “bull or bear” markets

Well, here is the actual definition of a Black Swan Event:

“A Black Swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.”

We knew months ago about the Evergrande situation, actually some users post about it here, in this subreddit. Also investors might have known this for many many months ahead of us. So in theory it doesn't fit in the category of a *Black Swan event*.

Also, we saw a lot of posts and comments saying “sell a little bit of your bag so you can buy the dip tomorrow”.

And, what actually happened? Well the CCP said 4 days ago they were planning to take control over the private sector.

And we also saw Evergrande saying that they will start their payments.

What do we need to learn from all of this? First, do your own research ALWAYS, don’t walk away with the first comment you see on internet and take action, dig a little bit and then make a plan of action and stick to it. Second of all, we don't know the outcome of any given situation, but there are a few that have better information than us, if you're not one of them, then please, just try to stay calm, zoom out, and you'll be just fine on the long term. Last but not least, have some fiat to play around, don't go all in, save some money to this kind of events so you can hold your initial position and in the event of a dip, you can buy some more, and have a better DCA.

The current narrative is that crypto will cause the next big crash.

I find it ironic that Satoshi invented Bitcoin in response to banks causing the 2008 financial crisis, and only 12 years later it is being blamed for an upcoming potential market crash.

[Drudge Report](https://www.drudgereport.com/) today has the following articles linked:

**Could Doom Dollar...**

**Crypto Equated to Toxic Pre-Crisis Swaps by Banking Watchdog...**

**Threat to Financial System...**

**Treasury Sanctions First Exchange...**

**Crackdown Gathers Steam...**

So as you can see, crypto is being blamed for any upcoming crashes. The [pre-crisis swap Yahoo article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-equated-toxic-pre-crisis-192241795.html) says this:

&gt;Notorious credit default swaps were engineered by math wizards in much the same way crypto has emerged. Crypto/DeFi today is on a path that looks similar to CDS in the early 2000’s.

&gt;How are the returns generated? It is hard to get straight answers that don’t quickly devolve into cryptospeak.

&gt;Crypto/DeFi solutions to problems in the real economy are rare

The [MSN article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crypto-risks-existential-threat-as-us-crackdown-gathers-steam/ar-AAOGPfQ) talks about 

&gt;Cryptocurrency firms are fighting for lobbyists and fielding subpoenas in what could be an existential fight over how the multitrillion-dollar industry should be regulated. In the past month, lobbyists have been overwhelmed by firms seeking representation in Washington, as regulators threaten the cryptocurrency companies with lawsuits or cease-and-desist orders. Current and former enforcers say those warnings are likely just the beginning. 

At least the Celsius CEO is fighting the good fight:

&gt;“We have to work twice as hard because these guys have the largest lobbyists working for them at both at the state and the federal level,” Mashinsky said. “We’ll prevail. The fight is over all the money in the world, right?”

Bitcoins are virtual assets that can be used in transactions. Their use relies on a technology that allows transactions to take place without any third party being involved. As of December 2018, the total number of bitcoins in circulation was 17.3 million. One bitcoin was worth $3,900, so the total value of the bitcoin stock was $67 billion. This may sound big, but it is very small compared to the total value of the stock of US currency, $1.5 trillion. Despite this, some bitcoin supporters argue that, one day, bitcoins will replace dollars (and euros and yen) as the currency used in most transactions. If this were to happen, the supply of currency would no longer be determined by the Fed (or other central banks), but by the mechanical rule that determines the creation of new bitcoins over time. Monetary policy as we know it would disappear (and much of my textbook would have to be rewritten). 

Is it at all conceivable? One can indeed imagine a world in which all prices were quoted in bitcoins, all interest rates were quoted in bitcoins, and people and firms did all their transactions in bitcoins. Then, there would be no reason to hold dollars, and dollars would indeed disappear. 

Is it likely to happen? No. For three reasons: 

First, for economic reasons. So long as most prices are quoted in dollars, transactions in bitcoins will involve what is known as ""price risk."" If the price of bitcoins in terms of dollars were stable, the risk would be limited. This is not the case. As shown in Figure 1 below, since its introduction, the price of bitcoins has fluctuated widely. From about $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, it soared to $19,300 at the end of 2017, only to fall back to $3,900 at the end of 2018. Holding bitcoins is a very risky proposition and is likely to remain so. 

(Yes I understand this data is outdated but we all agree on its current volitility)

Second, for technical reasons. The technology of bitcoins is such that the verification process and the creation of bitcoins are extremely expensive. The electricity used today by computers for Bitcoin-related operations would be enough to supply electricity to 4 million US households. Were the use of bitcoins increase dramatically, the costs would most likely follow. 

Third, for political reasons. Countries want to keep control of their monetary policy and will not relinquish it to private actors. Moving to an equilibrium where bitcoins become the main or the only currency would require a large coordination among price setters: You will typically not want to quote your prices in bitcoins if nearly everybody else quotes theirs in dollars. You will only do it if nearly everybody else quotes theirs in bitcoins. Such coordination to move from one equilibrium to the other can be achieved only with the help of the state. And the states will not willingly give up their currency.

I’m not saying it will, but just because the Chinese markets closed green today, doesn’t mean we’re in the clear yet.

Also just because some hedge fund managers and bank CEOs told us that all is well, and the renowned snake Cramer said that contagion can’t spread to the US markets - doesn’t mean it’s only up from here. It’s not like they don’t have conflicting interests. Their bags are harder to hedge, de-lever or outright sell than yours.

Evergrande aren’t even the only ones with ridiculous accounting and leverage practices. It’s the standard playbook for Chinese real estate companies. In fact Chinese companies in general are double as leveraged as the US, relative to GDP. Plus real-estate makes up a huge segment of both China’s GDP and investment. Real estate is China’s safe haven asset. Evergrande are property rich but cash poor. They alone could trigger a huge sell off and a massive haircut to the RE sector (which again, makes up a huge amount of their GDP ~30%).

Make no mistake, the underlying economies worldwide are already weakened by covid. In this era of globalisation, what happens in the world’s second largest economy definitely impacts everyone else. Also, as is ever the case, it’s very hard to tell who is holding the bags. Securities are chopped up and repackaged, swaps are bought, shell companies used etc. 

Then you have indirect exposure. A can’t pay B and now B can’t pay C and with growing defaults and a shortage of liquidity, creditors won’t (or can’t) fund any of them to roll over their debts. 

Plus there is the political side to this. Will China allow the tip of the iceberg to fall in their waters if they believe it will send a tsunami to America? 

And yeah this all affects crypto. It’s still a risky asset and in times of fud, money flows to “safer” investments. Plus stablecoins are mostly backed by tradfi assets.

I’m no expert. I’m just cautious to say we’re in the clear just yet. All I’m saying is just be careful on the hopium for now - let’s not call the bottom and pop the champagne just yet.

While some may understand it and are justifiably looking for short term profits but many are neglecting the fact that the world economy has been pumped and injected with trillions upon trillions of dollars during the last one year and a half with money that didn’t exist then. All the money that billionaires made you keep hearing about? Sure they came from their businesses doing well but where did it actually come from? Oh people are quitting their jobs but the housing markets keep pumping? I wonder why, oh wait no I don’t: cash is becoming cheap.

I guess you can look at it both ways: bitcoin was created for this exact reason, to be independent from the inflationary and illusory traditional centralized financial system so let’s all go in on it to truly free ourselves, or recognize that the whole world is in a tight little bubble that could burst at any moment now so grab as much cash as you can for the winter that’s coming.

Evergrande is not the end all that everyone claims it to be but it also isn’t just some FUD; it is the initial symptoms of a disease that’s about to flair up again.

True, no one can predict what will happen, but we shouldn’t be arguing about who was right yesterday and who is wrong today. We have to look at things on a larger scale and not just leer at the candles of tomorrow.

Shit is about to go down. No one knows when, but it’s due. They say don’t compare it to 2008, but that’s only thinking about Evergrande and not everything that’s been going on.

The DYOR blockchain stores information on the tokenomics, founders, funding and historical market data of each coin.

It's like an on chain wayback machine for the true historical data on every single coin.

While this is all cool the use case for the token seems quite low.  The DYOR token is used on the DYOR exchange to pay for searches about historical and current data for any crypto and their technical analysis based on this.  So the token is a payment for a search of its own blockchain. 

Overall, I am glad that the community is promoting a coin doing something interesting and innovative rather than just another shitcoin.

Are we still early to crypto?

​Last week, I stumbled upon an old Medium post from venture capitalist Chris McCann. The Solana and FTX seed investor showed via simple graphs that in 2018, the space was just beginning.

Are we still there? Are we still following the same trend of exponential growth?

I revisited and updated the graphs to find out:

**Bitcoin Wallet Address Growth**

The first metric: unique Bitcoin wallet addresses. The amount of total Bitcoin wallets today is closing in on 900 million. In May 2018, the number was about 398 million, which, in turn, forty months before was about 60 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/az9hojyzn4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f15cebda542a99f5175dfb41a1238398c274f2

So growth is slowing somewhat, although if we compare it to overall internet adoption, it’s tracking closely, as the rate of internet user growth leveled off over time as well.

It was in the 12th year of public use that the internet crossed one billion users, while Bitcoin is closing in on a billion addresses in its 13th year.

Then again, an address is not equivalent to a user, so it’s a bit more of a toss-up. Still, a doubling in three years is nothing to scoff at.

&amp;#x200B;

**Active Bitcoin Addresses:**

So how many of those addresses are actually active (that is, have sent or received any quantity of Bitcoin on a given day)? Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/16wzucv0o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91911f810e977fa3f677417918c75bb568fc1e0

For Bitcoin, two new peaks were reached in January and May of 2021 at approximately 1.25 million active wallets per day. The previous local peak was approximately 1.1 million in late 2017. Things in late 2017 looked to be going parabolic until transactions dropped down to 500,000/day in early 2018.

To me, this graph reflects on some of the transactional limitations related to Bitcoin. While there are definitely solutions to some of the volume-related problems surrounding Bitcoin, it’s possible that the slowing growth is correlated.

While it’d be impossible to collect the data for all cryptocurrencies, I’d postulate that growth is quite a bit higher for crypto as a whole. With 12,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, however, it’s nearly impossible to do the math.

**Ethereum Wallet Address Growth:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wnnokj23o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6db3f75c200072ec5827b021047ec564f17657

The number of total wallets and active wallets on Ethereum both look to be catching up to Bitcoin, a great sign for the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. The addition of L2s (blockchain ecosystems powered by altcoins built on top of Ethereum) probably actually underestimates these metrics as a proxy for how much total network activity exists.

That kick-up in late 2016 was due to an attack attempting to overwhelm Ethereum’s system with a high volume of addresses created.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1tz60d64o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=979ce3c5300349112963015ffc3de9a92927c164

We can also check out active wallets on Ethereum: this graph’s steadier growth and higher 2021 peaks lends credibility to our hypothesis that overall network capability leads to more activity growth. While Bitcoin’s percentage of active wallets has slowly dropped (about .3% in 2018), Ethereum’s percentage of active wallets stays more consistent.​

**Exchange Activity:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/od9ami45o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03710aa06eeef81abb8c3ff98be1dc2953013cc6

I couldn’t find great compiled data on total exchange user growth over time, but we can use volume to understand how much money flows through crypto markets. ​

While this graph roughly traces Bitcoin price activity, we can see that higher highs have a multiplying effect on exchange volume: a total crypto market cap doubling leads to about 3 times as much exchange activity. For evidence of this, check out Jan 2018 vs. Jun 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchange Market Share:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/28fphcv6o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f729e20669c2b5f57ff601396a3609d4f57de51b

Removing decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap from the picture, we’ve seen a massive broadening of the exchange landscape. Only a few exchanges (Coinbase and Binance, most notably) have been able to increase market share as a percentage. Including data from DEXs further muddies the waters.

I think this is an incredibly bullish sign for crypto growth and a real-life example of the concept of decentralization. If we look at the search engine wars of the early 2000s, at this point in time (relative to years since public launch), Google had well over half of market share. Binance barely cracks 15%.

There are two ways to look at this, but both are good signs for crypto investors:

1. If crypto forever remains decentralized in terms exchange volume, without any one player gaining too strong of an advantage, that’s a good thing for crypto.
2. If crypto exchange volume does someday consolidate, it will be a long time from now, which means we’re early.

Internationalization, decentralization, and different value propositions by exchanges are all good signs that we’re still early to crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**Total Adoption by User Rates:**

One of the most fascinating parts of Chris McCann’s analysis was his comparison of crypto growth to internet growth. DeutscheBank has since done its own study of the blockchain vs. the internet, below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p4lb0ax7o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2309c2bb3d84d9b431410cf83ee2b06eeea64f

The first thing to note is that these two graphs exist on different axes and have already diverged. It is almost definitive now that crypto will grow slower than the internet, while in 2018 it was still a tossup as to which might grow faster.

But while crypto’s growth has been slower than the internet’s, the coefficient of that growth might be accelerating.

In their projections, DeutscheBank guessed that by 2030, total cryptocurrency users would cross 200 million. But today, in September, we sit at well over 220 million users by many estimates, fueled by a manic bull run.

The math shows that it’d be quite difficult for crypto’s overall user base to overtake the internet’s user base at an equivalent point in time. However, it looks quite possible that crypto crosses a billion users much sooner than expected and, well, that’d be pretty good news for crypto prices.

**​**

**So...Are We Early?**

In 2018, many graphs pointed to crypto taking the same path as the internet to complete world domination. Today, though, it’s harder to have that same level of optimism.

While at this point, we know crypto won’t be quicker to worldwide adoption than the internet, at this point in time, it's on a good track to eventually get there.

Here’s what we can state with certainty:

1. Growth in the crypto world has slowed down.
2. There are now over 200 million cryptocurrency users.
3. Things have never been so bullish for crypto.

While McCann in 2018 could fairly compare the growth of crypto to the growth of the internet as a whole, perhaps today, making that comparison is a little too optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Frontiers of Crypto**

Chris McCann’s article serves as a bit of a time capsule to cryptocurrency in 2018, without a mention of DeFi or NFTs: the concepts barely even existed yet.

&gt;""My biggest criticism towards the DApp future is we haven’t seen DApp usage keep pace with the number of DApps being created. The current core use cases of cryptocurrencies are speculation, store of value, assets, payments, etc.”

Today, though there are many use cases for crypto! DeFi, yield farming, loans, decentralized exchanges, platforms like Theta and Audius which hold data on the blockchain.

So as far as where the next opportunities in cryptocurrency lie, it’s likely that you haven’t even heard of them yet: and it’s that way by nature. Small projects with big ideas have a lot more room for growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case Studies on Parabolic growth**

To illustrate my point, I’d like to show a few graphs that couldn’t have even been imaginable three years ago. Here’s a graph from TheBlockCrypto.com of the total value of the assets locked in DeFi:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sole5jt9o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3483656efc875bfaeb820577562661bed582b11d

A sector of the industry Chris didn't even touch on has now almost kissed $100 billion! Unthinkable three years ago.​

And below is a graph of volume on NFT marketplaces. A year ago, Opensea did under $50k in daily volume. Today, it will do approximately $90 million. That’s an 1800x in just one year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pyawfbtao4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ac4b036ddb06b9c83ef310f180f6f75b197be5

If you’re investing in crypto, well, it’s evident that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have slowed down in growth: and that makes sense: it’s harder to move the price of assets as they grow in size.

​But if you want to know where to find that explosive 10x, 100x, 1000x investment, it’s the new trends **within** cryptocurrency, it's the cutting edge, the latest innovations, that have the potential to explode.

**For me, that means investing in the altcoins and protocols that will serve as facilitators for this new world of online wealth creation.**

For you, it might be something else: Yield Farming, DeFi, decentralized insurance. Explore what's new, explore your curiosity, and you might just find something that explodes.

Edit: Didn’t realize this would get so much traction! I know Reddit hates self promo, but I write a newsletter on altcoins that you’ll probably like if you liked this post.

neither has your story--well, most of you.

I started investing in crypto February 1st, 2021. Ever since then I've been DCAing every 2 weeks or so. I've got what I'm sure is considered a small bag of the stuff, but it's all I can do right now. And even with this current dip, I'm still up. And I'm making a much higher percentage return than my .02% savings account (well, it's empty, but if there was money in there...).

Here's the deal: I didn't buy in 2020, 2019, or 2016. I've been in this space since 8 months ago. That's it. So, whenever I see these posts about ""IF"" they don't really help anyone. It's just a breeding ground for regret. Don't bother reading them.

Stick to the basic rules if you're not a trader or speculator.  

**1. Only put in what you can lose.**

**2. Research coins/tokens that provide real world value.**  

**3. Stick with coins that have a limited supply.**  

**4. DCA when you can.**  

**5. Hodl-4-evah.**  

Reminder: When the market is down, 1 BTC=1 BTC and you only lose money if you sell.  

So, give it time and eventually you'll be one of those people who can relate to: ""If you bought BTC in Feb of 2021...""  and you can shout, **""HEY THAT'S ME!""**

Here is the list, I added a few popular Reddit coins in here too. 

1. Bitcoin-Too expensive for the average or new investor to want to get into.    
2. Ethereum-Barrier of entry is high due to killer gas fees. Normal investors won’t want to use it.    
3. Cardano    
4. Binance Coin    
5. XRP    
6. Solana-is centralized and they can hit the kill switch as they have demonstrated.       
7. Polkadot    
8. Dogecoin- is a meme and will never peak again. SHIB is the new meme and better in every single way.    
9. Terra    
10. Avalanche    

Others

1. Algo    
2. Tezos    
3. Polygon    
4. Stellar    
5. Harmony One-Team markets Harmony One terribly
6. VeChain    
7. Monero- Too private to ever be mass adopted.    
8. Moons- Use case isn’t good enough.

Currently in the early stages of developing an investment tracker app for iOS and Android (website may come later on).

In short: This app would sync together all of your investment accounts i.e. stock brokerages, crypto exchanges, etc in one app to better track your investments and total portfolio worth. Other features like analytics will be added but this is the core focus.

The app will be very customizable to tailor to each individual desires on what they want to see.

As someone who enjoys ramen regardless of my investment strategy I will share a few tips on how to make it a nutritious meal quite cheaply so you guys don’t all get scurvy before you get to retire…

- Add some carrot gratings/shavings

-  Add spring onions/scallions 

-  Add coriander/cilantro or another green herb of your choice.

- Add a few drops of lime/lemon juice or wine vinegar 

In the UK, this would only add another 16pence per bowl (I live in South London) and ensures you are getting some much needed nutrients.

And if you’re feeling decadent like it’s a Friday night or something then I would recommend the following also:

- Finely sliced pan fried bacon (or veggie equivalent like facon or crispy onions).

- Black sesame seeds 

- Sesame oil

This project is bringing DeFi capabilities to the crypto king (saw somewhere that if Bitcoin is the crypto king, then Sovryn is its queen) and letting it make its mark in the sector that has been experiencing rapid growth over the past year , even through the periods of lull that cryptocurrencies have gone through. The protocol supports instant trades between tokens in a cost effective manner, lets users perform long and short trades and even borrow leverage from the lending pool. In addition, token holders also have the opportunity to lend their holdings to margin traders and borrowers, earning interest in the process. What’s more, investors can use their BTC tokens from any Bitcoin wallet via smart contracts and decentralized products on the Sovryn protocol.

Following the success of it's listing on Ascendex, the price of SOV has taken to an upward trend in the global market amassing over 100% increase from when it was listed till now even though the crypto market is in real dip. Also the price and performance of SOV is now trackable on coinbase. Gate\_io another CEX has listed SOV after the project registered over 12m votes to beat Gate’s 10m vote requirement to list the token. An indication that the community and SOV holders are more than happy to see more CEX listings for this blue chip. Next stop, ATH or beyond? We’ll see. 

In a recent update from the project, users can now go long on SOV in sovryn's leveraged margin trading, up to 5x. An amazing feature for ardent traders, long is the game, even when the market is in a dip, SOV keeps pumping.

It's no doubt that SOVRYN might have more surprises for its token holders which are most likely in the pipeline. I personally look forward to its listing on coinbase or probably other top tier exchanges like binance which I presume will be as close as Gate listing is to AscendEX. 

Why am I bullish on this project? This tweet says it all;

**Always make 50 percent of your portfolio ETH or BTC.**

so before this ""crash"" my portfolio was severely made up with the alts, and i have never ever saw the face of profit from them, the only thing i've got; was 32 percent loss from my whole investment.

Now after the crash, i understood that im not smarter than everybody else by investing in alts to see a small pump and live in hawai with my lambo...

**NEVER, FUCKIN EVER, listen to Redditors, especially for investments...**

So they were tens of posts that highligting ""**a new catastrophic crash""** is on the way, and that i was so convinced i have sold, **MY WHOLE INVESTMENT, AT %30 LOST**, *to buy it cheap later.*

I see a lot of hate for dogecoin as a crypto about how the coin itself will rip people off or ""rugpull"" them. This is just false, the problem you have with dogecoin is not the coin itself, but the community.

The coin is not great, let's be real - it's a copy of litecoin designed to be a joke with no infinite limit on the number of coins. The brand can never be anything more than a joke because it's a picture of an internet meme. It is pretty cheap and fast to send money though, and the brand IS recognizable. It's also a Proof of Work coin so everything is secure and literally cannot be rugged by the devs. It's never going to be a huge crypto other than as a gimmick.

The real problem you should have is with the toxic community surround Doge! The community used to be really fun and generous when the coin was a tiny fraction of the price it was no. Constant tipping, funny memes, they even sponsored a racer at Nascar before crypto sponsors were really a thing. 

Then the price started to go up after GME and the whales (who hold large portions of dogecoin) took full advantage of the noobs getting in to pump the price, then we had the Elon SNL sketch &amp; the doge community trying to shill their bags with promises of $1, $10 etc.

There were 2 phrases the community used to used sincerely, now they feel hollow and points:

1. **D**o **O**nly **G**ood **E**veryday - This really encapsulated the doge community spirit in the early days when it truly was about making peoples lives better and having fun.
2. 1 doge = 1 doge - The concept that doge is not about monetary value but to be used as a currency and it's for the community.

If your strategy is buy the dip, go for it, but by no means is the market out of the woods right now.   


To recap where we stand on the China market situation

1. Evergrande is $300 billion in debt. They have regular interest payments due to creditors on their outstanding bonds. If they don't make those payments, they are considered in default and at risk for liquidation or government intervention. These bonds fall into 2 categories, ""onshore"" bonds, which are denominated in Chinese YUAN, and ""offshore"" bonds, which are denominated in USD.   
Yesterday we got word Evergrande negotiated with the creditors privately to make payments on the ONSHORE part of their bonds.  About $35.9 million. This is mildly positive. HOWEVER there is still an $83 million dollars in offshore payments due tomorrow which they have not made comment on.  [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/evergrande-debt-crisis-interest-payments-on-bondsimpact-on-investors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/evergrande-debt-crisis-interest-payments-on-bondsimpact-on-investors.html)     

2. Evergrande was never going to go bankrupt overnight as some seem to think was the expectation. They have 30 days after missing a payment to settle debts before an official default. This is a slow rolling train, not an overnight thing.   

3. Even if they make their interest payments, they still hold $300 billion in principal debt. Until that debt is paid down they are at risk.  

4. The ""market contagion"" effect is still unknown. Analysts really have no idea the full extent of who is exposed to Evergrande debt and in which markets. Furthermore, Evergrande is not the only at-risk large property developer in China.   

5. China has sent some signals that they are willing to bail out some domestic lenders, but have not made any certain indications they will bail out Evergrande directly. They are not treating this as a ""too big to fail"" situation.  

6. TL;DR - China markets is still a threat.  

Aside from Evergrande, there is a ton of other movement in the crypto world right now. Gary Gensler went out in an interview yesterday pretty much laying out his play of attack with crypto regulations. He implied any exchanges that don't register with them immediately are going to be seeing a lot of trouble. DeFi, staking, and all crypto lending is about to be a prime target. And Stablecoins are almost certainly going to see some sort of heavy regulation or outright ban.

Worries about highly indebted property developer China Evergrande’s ability to pay interest on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds have prompted comparisons to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the subsequent financial crisis. 

When it comes to the actual scale of impact, analysts point out that China’s Evergrande holds land, while Lehman held financial assets. 

China has the tools and policies necessary to prevent this situation from turning into a systemic crisis! 

Evergrande has a series of interest payments that are to be payed from now into the end of the year. They have successfully been able to pay off their first interest payment Today, and I believe they will continue to make their payments where it counts. 

While Evergrande is able to sell some of their assets to meet their interest payment needs, it is still apparent that this situation is not going away and it may indeed be a bubble. One of the ways that Evergrande can make its payment is to receive a bailout. Bailouts are basically the government stepping in and turning on their money churning machines and sending said money to necessary destinations. 

While the Insecurity of Evergrande's Future may cause some short-term declines in the Crypto industry, the reality is that it is the most BULLISH reason to support crypto if I have ever seen one.   


Time after time you have heard the old saying: 

# ""Too big to fail""

&amp;#x200B;

The Reality is that the current way in which our financial system is structured, there are companies that are indeed to big to fail as we are operating on an inflationary asset --&gt; Insert USD, CNY, RNB, GBP   etc. 

As long as we as a society operate using and Inflationary asset, i.e. allow governments to print as much money as needed to bail out these large companies, we will not be free from Bubbles created by these Behemoths. 

If we operated where Bitcoin was the global reserve currency, and each currency denominated its value from BTC, bailing out these companies would have far worse repercussions for the state that is issuing the bailout. It would directly devalue their currency while the price of BTC remains high as you can not inflate the amount of BTC available.  


These BIG companies recognize that they are able to leverage their positions for opportunities at high % gains, while at the same having high risk tolerance. These big companies are constantly in talks with the wrong people in the right places (insert generic politicians). Often you will find that politicians profit off of these behemoths through ""smart investing"" and **\*NoT iNsIdE tRaDiNg\*** and \***NoT kIcKbAcKs\*** and **\*NoT CaMpAiGn FuNdInG\*.** 

So it is in the financial interest of the politicians to bail these companies out. Not to mention the fact that ordinary people, parents, grandparents etc. trust these big financial companies with their life savings/pensions as these companies are the leaders in the industry and the ""Smart"" way to store your money. So if politicians did not bail them out, a lot of people would be \*\*\*\* out of luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

# So with all that said, what will happen with Evergrande? 

To be honest, no one knows and anyone who says they do is a liar and you should slap them (Not life advice). 

**In my opinion we will be in rough waters (ups and downs) as each interest payment is due. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a 30%+ correction at some point. But the reality is it doesn't matter.**   


**1 BTC will always = 1 BTC.** 

Does it make sense to store your $ in Fiat when the value of said fiat is decreasing due to inflation? 

As the FIAT Structures in place continue to Devalue their Money, Crypto becomes more and more valuable as the scarcity is revealed. So sure you might have short-term loses, but I can tell you one thing: While $1 could buy you a candy bar in 2011, and 1 BTC could buy you a candy bar in 2011, $1 today can buy you .5-.75 of a candy bar, 1 BTC can buy you 40,000+ Candy today.

This Trend will continue. 

My goal is to hopefully have BTC be able to buy me 4,000,000 candy bars, at which point i will build a house out of purely chocolate.

So a few minutes ago I saw a post about Bitcoin being freedom from institutional plans to control the world. It actually got me thinking...

What if crypto is actually part of their plan to control the world? Let me explain.

Some of you might be familiar with a theory that there are a small class of ultra elite individuals who want to control the world through a one world government and a single global currency. Now you might be thinking there's no way our digital decentralized coins could be their meal ticket. After all, it's actually our meal ticket to get away from banks and corrupt jabronis who don't have our best interests at heart. 

But here's the thing: something like let's say XLM could be their way of trying to get that global currency movement going.

Those fuckers are smart too. They know we don't trust them. They know we would never accept a global currency that comes from elitists. So they came up with Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. 

They made it sound like crypto is for the people and by the people. They tout it as a way to get away from those nasty bankers and Wall Street bitches with their snail pace stock market bullshit. They manipulated the market to entice all of us who aren't under their control. Those of us who are skeptics of the current financial system, they want us. They need us to attain full control.

They then started phase two of the plan. Introducing altcoins and charismatic leaders. They did this because they need to control everyone and they want to cover all their tracks. 

In time, coins with low transaction fees and quick transaction times will become a global standard for moving money without the hassle of local currency conversion. Once this has happened, they win.

And that's when they shut it all down and plunge the world into chaos. Just like they always planned. From the chaos rises the New World Order and a one world government takes charge.

They can stop you from borrowing it if they don't want you to. 

They can even stop you from having a bank account

The alternative is Decentralised finance, Defi, where there are no banks, instead there are pieces of code that run and act as a bank.

They're open to anyone, They don't require you to trust them because they're literally a piece of code running a program.

If you wanted to you could read through it and verify that it's not going to scam you.

They are also censorship resistant and lastly they are much much cheaper than traditional centralized finance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Decentralised finance is built on three main things,

1. Cryptography 
2. The blockchain technology
3. Smart contracts 

&amp;#x200B;

Five Pillars of DeFI,

1. Stable Coins.
2. Lending and Borrowing.
3. Decentralised Exchanges.
4. Insurance
5. Margin Trading 

&amp;#x200B;

Stable Coins - 

So first off we need to understand the bridge of decentralised finance to centralised finance and that is, cryptocurrency that is matched to a real-world asset.

&amp;#x200B;

For Example,

Dai, Tether and USD coin are all what we call stable coins.

This is because their price is tied to the united states dollar. 

Think about it like this when you buy one for one dollar

a new USD coin is minted when you withdraw one, a USD coin is burned, so the coin is always worth one united states dollar.

Now the purpose of this is to have a reliable way to buy and sell certain coins without having to

buy and sell them. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Borrowing and Lending -

So another important pillar of decentralised finance is lending and borrowing.  

In fact a huge part of our current financial situation in the world is based on lending and borrowing money so it would make sense that the blockchain could do it better, Using Code, with complete anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

# Decentralized Exchanges - 

So I have a friend who traveled to london a few years ago from the United

States, now of course in london the standard currency is euros

while over here in the US it's dollars.

So naturally he had to visit a foreign exchange booth and trade out his dollars

for euros unfortunately for him the fee was like 15 so he immediately lost 15 percent of

his money.

Because that's what foreign exchange traders do. Tourists don't know any

better and they need local money so what they do is they take advantage of these

people.

Well when it comes to Decentralised Finance, Instead of a foreign exchange

trader we have what is called a Decentralised exchange, where you can

exchange your coins and tokens for other coins and tokens.

Now the fees are usually very small like less than half of a percent which is a

great benefit for anyone who regularly wants to trade their crypto assets.

# Insurance - 

In today’s volatile market, Collateral Protection Insurance provides borrowers and lenders with a sense of security from crypto lending networks, which is a critical step in advancing blockchain adoption. 

# Margin Trading - 

DeFi crypto margin trading refers to the practice of using borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for the loan from the broker. Usually broker in DeFi it’s one of autonomous money markets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Pros of Defi -

1. Permissionless
2. Immutability
3. Transparency
4. Lending and Borrowing Applications.
5. Savings Applications.
6. Tokenization

&amp;#x200B;

# Cons of Defibrillates - 

1. Scalability
2. Uncertainty
3. Concerns of Liquidity

I used a market cap of $825 Billion and a per coin price of $45,000 for simplicity sake.

Dividing the million dollar purchase by the full market cap gets us to a percentage increase of around 0.00012%, which would equate to about a $5.5 increase in total price (again this is if everything could be bought at the same level disregarding you realisticly have to pay a bigger amount per coin for each dollar spent).

Not a huge difference for a million buckaroos, but what about a billion?

Well adding a couple more zeroes using the same method gives us about a $55 increase to the total price per coin, which is actually fairly substantial all things considered, and that price goes even higher when you consider you'll be paying more dollars per amount of coin as the transactions mount.

Recently, as the world cheered on ES for taking an enormous leap forward and adopting BTC, the political milieu in ES has been alarming.

 What constitutes alarming? My parents have been saying for months that ES is slowly marching into a dictatorship due to increasing centralization of governmental powers to Nayib Bukele (ES president), nepotism, shady backroom deals, and the firing of an attorney general investigating Bukele. 

Last week this claim got realer than real for me as my parents brought my grandma to the US(to live permanently) and are beginning to sell properties in ES. This is wild because my grandma never wanted to leave ES, and if you saw the properties she is now selling you would understand why--ENORMOUS plots of land and my grandfather is buried in ES. 

With all that being said, I now wonder if ES's march towards authoritarianism will reflect poorly on BTC. Will it give US regulators another villain to point at and use as an example to buttress their arguments against  crypto? I don't know, but would love to hear feedback. I generally lurk on reddit, but with the recent change to Bukele's Twitter bio made me seek out a second opinion.......I think it's probably a joke, but there is always some truth in jest. pic related./

Of course, I did this without factoring in fees, taxes, and other bullshit, just see what happens to test how effective active trading can be.

I start with the premise that you buy $1k worth of BTC on January 1st.  See what happens below:

I used available data from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/ and https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/

So you could have turned $1000 into $16,474 (+1647% increase) or got .414 BTC for $1k.  It does appear that you are especially skilled and have magnificent insight, you can do significantly better than just HODLING (which would have turned $1000 into $1128, a 13% increase).

So what are your further plans? I believe some of you may ""hodl"" until the next growth. And such a strategy takes place, especially for long-term investors! However, how do you consider earning interest strategy while simply holding?  


There’s a great way that many of you had already heard of — making money with your cryptocurrency while waiting for it to go up in value through interest payments on cryptocurrency investment platforms.  


The first thing that comes to my mind is something like Blockfi, which is probably described as the easiest method of earning interest on your Bitcoin. It is a financial company specializing in digital assets that provides services to both businesses and individuals. After registering for an account, a user stores their cryptocurrency on the platform, where it earns interest of up to 8.6% (verify that). Blockfi pays interest monthly. The platform does not have a deposit limit for minimum or maximum amounts, making it a good place for both beginners and experienced investors.    


How about DeFi space? Here I turned my attention to a Swiss DeFi asset management company called Midas Yield. The company explores and uses liquidity providing, lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities on over 50 DeFi protocols to offer the best yields across multiple assets. One of the core yield sources is concentrated liquidity providing on Uniswap V3, the biggest decentralized exchange. The platform doesn't lock users' assets and pays daily interests up to 13%.  


But, man, what about dessert? Of course, I couldn't get past Crypto.com — more than one million users platform. Unlike some of the other savings platforms, crypto.com is available only as a mobile app. The website exists as an information and marketing vehicle. The platform supports more than 90 cryptocurrencies that can be used to earn interest or be bought and sold by users. The interest rates are up to 12%.

I usually love solid projects with real use cases such as Eth, Link, LTO, Atom, Ect. However, I found Cake Monster about a month ago and thought the whitepaper on it was interesting and different compared to most other meme projects I have come across. This posts purpose is to go over the mechanisms involved with Cake Monster as I currently understand it and generate discussion on how it may work out and if it will work. 

# Tokenomics:

So to boil this down simply there are several aspects to this project that give it value since it lacks a utility or usecase. 

1. A 5% tax is levied on every trade involving Cake monster with 2.5% being burned taking away from the total supply. The other 2.5% goes into buying cake for the vault (more on this in a moment) and adding some Monsta tokens to the liquidity pool
2. The Cake vault is accumulated Cake by the tax and is staked in a syrup pool that is locked until either the total supply of monsta is 1 million or 2 years has passed from launch. After this whatever percent of the total monsta supply you own is the percent of the cake vault that is given to you. 
3. After the cake vault is distributed a new cycle starts where all previous monsta are burned and the original supply is reminted where whoever claimed Cake from the vault also get that percentage of Monsta from the new minted supply restarting the cycle over again. 

Example: 1 millon supply reached. You have 100,000 monsta (10%). Vault has 100 million cake (IDK what it really will be). 

You get 10 million cake (10%) and then 10% of the new monsta supply (8.5 billion total supply i believe at start) so you get 850 million monsta tokens and the cycle of burning and adding to the vault starts over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. All wallets owning monsta must make a transaction of at least 5.01% every 50 days or they can get cashed out (70% of your monsta converted to BNB with the rest going to the vault or being burned). They have an auto cash out button that basically just sells then rebuys 5.01% of your stack costing you a 0.25% fee to reset the timer. This is interesting as it keeps the burning occurring and the vault will always grow (which taking into account added cake from taxes and staking the vault is calculated at a 27,000% apy currently, which sounds like BS but is not due to them taking into account supply burn increasing your stake in the vault, staking rewards, and tax additions to the vault.) 

Basically it is a perpetual hyper deflationary token which drives the price of monsta up while also providing an asset in a vault that backs the value so there is always a ""real"" value the monsta is worth.

&amp;#x200B;

#  Why Buy It

So there is no use case, and people that buy in early benefit the most hypothetically by having a ton of the asset and can dump on new people. Sounds a lot like any other shitcoin like Doge or Shib at first. However doing math and considering the broad impacts if those people with lots of coins dumping on you, they will add value to the cake vault, lower the total supply, and increase the percentage of the vault you own with your tokens. Thus any activity by whales actually can help people buying in later for higher prices still make money. You can make the choice to sell at the current monsta price or keep your coins and claim the value of the vault at the end.

 Will some people eventually buy in at too high a price that they are paying more than their token share will be worth for vault rewards? maybe but they could sell those tokens at a higher price or the vault may continue to increase making them profit in the future either way. 

&amp;#x200B;

# My Opinion

Some people can and will lose money by buying this token for too high a price that it will peak and their share of tokens will have cost more than the vault will be worth for them, but holding it and claiming the vault as well as being minted the same percentage in monsta tokens of the next cycle may prove to be profitable even in that situation. It is an interesting gamification dynamic of a token that may be capable of creating wealth for many people and not just early adopters. I am intrigued buy how this will play out over this first cycle and future ones as well for people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your opinions but please read the white paper first. I am not an expert on the token and left out some things like the NFTs and road map objectives of the token that can be found on the website and the whitepaper.

So, I compared how much money you would have made going into crypto vs. the stock market, represented by the S&amp;P 500.

I only compared the stock market to Bitcoin and Ethereum. I know there are many alt coins that have shot up much higher, but many of them crashed too, so with anything, make sure you trust the particular coins you are investing in.

If you had invested $1,000 into the S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2016, then on January 1st, 2021, it would be worth $2,030.54. Not at all a bad return on your investment over 5 years.

If you had invested $1,000 into Bitcoin on January 1st, 2016, then on January 1st, 2021 it be worth. $675,713.81 This is life changing money.

If you had invested $1,000 into Ethereum on January 1st, 2016, then on January 1st, 2021 it would be worth. $7,925,434.78   This is retirement forever money.

Obviously, this does not guarantee you'd see the same results if you wait 5 years from now. I picked 5 years because it was easier and Ethereum was only invented the previous year. But, I think this can give some perspective. We're not as early as we would have been in 2016, but if we can come close to replicating that sort of success over the next 5 or even ten years, I'd be thrilled.

While the majority probably didn't know shit about fuck, and even many who got it right, probably got lucky, there was still some really good research out there, and good understanding, that stood out from the fluff of people pulling stuff out of their asses with misconstrued narratives.

**Here's how to tell the difference:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1- Watch out for posts with more fluff than facts.**

Notice how one of the top posts saying we would crash today had actually 0 real back up for its argument. No specific examples of a precedent for its claim. Not many facts. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psoty7/the\_evergrande\_crisis\_isnt\_fud\_get\_ready\_for\_big/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psoty7/the_evergrande_crisis_isnt_fud_get_ready_for_big/)

Even one of its only points that was tied to an actual fact, was about how China is not showing signs of pressing the bailout button. Wouldn't that actually point out that China isn't seeing this as something damaging enough?

Posts like that along with people claiming that this is similar to 2008, should have indicated that they may have not fully understood the situation.

**2- Watch out for the ""Hitler"" comparison.**

This is when people make wild hyperbolic comparisons, that don't actually draw very direct parallels. Only maybe in the 3rd degree. In this case the ""Hitler"" was comparing it to the more alarming 2008 crash. Sometimes the comparison will be true, if it has identical parallels that can be drawn. 

Even if I believed Evergrande was gonna be disastrous for China, which it can still be, as someone who has followed the stock market since the 80s, I would have never say it's like 2008. It simply is not. That's a whole other post to explain that, but different roots, different policies, different dynamics at play.

People saw ""real estate"" and a major institution going down and just oversimplified it as 2008 2.0. 

**3- Where is the understanding of the players involved?**

In this case an understanding for China and its past.

The big difference between people who called a crash, and those who saw signs of a potential overreaction, is simply in their understanding of how China works. Comparing it to 2008 showed a lack of understanding in the differences between the US market and China. 

This guy who said we might be overreacting had a really good understanding of China:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psis16/evergrande\_thoughts\_from\_an\_ex\_hedge\_fund\_analyst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psis16/evergrande_thoughts_from_an_ex_hedge_fund_analyst/)

But it's also important to get the correct historic events, to have the correct precedent. Which in this case wasn't 2008, but 2015. 

In 2015 the Chinese economy tanked. It sent ripples across other markets. Despite China being an economic giant and major trader, it didn't crash world economies into a depression. We only had correction level dips. Because as big as China is, it's not embedded in world economies in the same way the US is, nor are world economies marching to the beat of the drum of China in the same way as the US. 

**4- The devil is in the details.**

Key details will usually mean the difference between getting something wrong or right. 

Whether it's in the details of Chinese policy, the dynamics of their economy, or the current state of the market. 

One example is how Lehman brothers was a flawed comparison to Evergrande. Especially in the impact of its repayment. People who understood this in more details, would have pointed out that Lehman never had the same physical assets that Evergrande had to use as collateral. And Evergrande is not as deeply embedded in major institutions or major banks as Lehman Brothers was. Two crucial small details.

**5- The importance of the context, and understanding the state of the market.** 

A crash happening at more vulnerable times, or during bearish times, would have had different implications. 

But you have to put things in context, to fully understand what impact they may have, and the more likely scenario.

Something that was almost never mentioned by people calling it 2008 2.0. 

In this case, we have markets that have been brushing off major bankruptcies for 2 years. Including brushing off entire industries tanking, and still finding new highs and more bullishness. How is big real estate bankruptcy in China, much more damaging than Covid, or a rain of bankruptcies, or entire industries tanking? It was never properly explained by the alarmists. This market has a certain psychology, and maybe even irrationality that you have to understand, before you can understand how it will react. How is that irrational bullishness, and quickness at brushing off bad news different this time?

**Conclusion**

There were too many important details that were never explained in the theory of 2008 2.0. That should have raised some red flags. Even if Evergrande doesn't make all its payments, can it really tank China? It doesn't have those same elements Lehman Brothers had to fully drag many important institutions with it. But even if it somehow manages to do it, will it really be that different from 2015? Will it even be able reach those levels to tank the Chinese economy like 2015?

And in the context of the market, in 2015 markets were still in recovery mode, and didn't have the irrational bullish psychology the market has now, of being able to brush off even major crises. 

Don't get me wrong, I think the stock market is in a growing bubble. But it won't be a bankruptcy, or a major negative black swan even that will end the bull market. This type of market psychology will be killed with the opposite. It's when things go too well and it enters a mania phase, and flies too close to the sun, that it will finally crash back to reality. But that's something to be explained with more details for another post.

I began getting interested in finance around 2017. I started off with cryptocurrencies but also have been branching out to fiat such as 401Ks and mutual funds. I had access to a free CFP through work and one of the first things I did since I was a new parent and husband was establish a 6 month emergency fund. At the time high-yield savings accounts had APYs of around 2.5-3% I think. Seemed like a good deal since that meant my nest egg will stay above inflation. Win-win or so I thought. Little did I know that those APYs are not fixed. During the past year my APY on that ""high-yield"" savings account has been 0.2-0.4%... It feels silly to just let money sit there losing value because I need some economic security. So my question is....

&amp;#x200B;

Why not just move my emergency savings account into DAI?

&amp;#x200B;

I can think of a few pros and cons.

Pros:

\- 2% APY that compounds and pays out daily.

\- Its a sable coin so it shouldn't lose value (in theory).

\- Its liquid so I can pull on it for emergencies from basically anywhere in the world and convert it to any currency.

\- No minimum for the maximum APY (common for high-yield savings accounts).

\- Seems immune to current market issues (maybe?).

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- I might be more heavily taxed on my returns from it compared to the traditional savings account.

\- Who is to say if DAI will exist in the future. I know this argument can be used for literally anything including to USD but lets be realistic here.

\- The APY is also not fixed just like my savings account.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something here? Any reason to keep my emergency fund in a traditional bank? Is the future truly now old man?

Some things I have to consider are the fact that I will be changing careers soon due to medical issues preventing me from doing all of my duties at my current job. So I may need that emergency fund to cover a month or two of expenses while I move and find a new job. The positive is that I also will qualify for an AER loan for the rest of my life with 0% interest for any type of emergency that comes up. So I kinda have two safety nets to keep my family stable.

Here we stand today and the market is actually climbing very smoothly from its somewhat harsh panic Monday, contrary to the popular belief of multiple ""experts"" so congrats to those of you that didn't falter to the FUD.

However. I do want to stress that this evergrande thing is not actually over, and today does nothing to change the situation the market is in even excluding one company.

Bond payments have an entire 30 days until they're actually considered ""defaults"". Evergrande has the benefit of being able to sit on these repayments for another few weeks before the proverbial shit actually hits the fan for them specifically.

Now this company by themselves is small cake compared to everything else going on in the financial world, and I also personally think China once again ""banning bitcoin"" actually saved the space a shit load of exposure during this recent round of fear considering many Chinese businessmen likely already sold off many of their bags awhile ago.

But that doesn't change the fact we all know China has a huge shadow banking problem ran on a massive amount of bad debt that's going to pop sometime in the near future.

And when that happens, there is going to be a huge pull for highly liquid currency, which will likely see the fire sale of properties en mass and a price drop in the short term for the entire crypto space as the need for liquidity rises.

But you know what? This is going to be HUGE for crypto to prove it can compete with the real estate market as a store of value.

We all know the real estate market is in a huge bubble, and when that pops, everything will drop, but I guarantee the crypto space will hold and then return to its value way quicker than any other form of value. So if you really believe in this space, I honestly think you should be rooting for the bubble to pop, because it's only going to prove the space's value and change the entire perception to people not totally sold yet.

Let's talk about why trading always loses money.

You must know that the biggest opponent of traders is not the market, nor the elusive market trends, but ourselves.

In the past year, 80 out of 100 people may have asked me to help them identify the reasons for their losses. So today I will combine my trading experience to talk about the 6 most difficult demons to overcome in my own trading history.

You can look for your own demons together, and destroy them together if you find them. If you don't, work together to compound interest in the currency circle for a long time.

**Inner Demon** **1: Greed**

Greed is the biggest demon in trading. As long as you develop greed, it must be a deep abyss. It can be said that 90% of the psychological problems in trading come from greed.

What are the manifestations of greed?

Do not want to miss the market, want to buy at the lowest point, sell at the highest point, is greedy.

Don't want to miss the market of any variety, it is greed.

Want to pursue the perfect trading system is greed.

Even unwillingness to accept losses is greedy.

Pursuing huge profits and heavy trading is even more greedy.

The naive pursuit of financial freedom is the greed of greed.

There are too many such examples.

**How to deal with it?**

Change cognition. Any trading system has its own rate of return, and long-term stable and reasonable returns are the pursuit of trading.

I am a victim of greed myself.

When I started trading, I quickly achieved some results, which made my heart like a balloon extremely inflated.

The purpose of my trading is to achieve financial freedom. In order to achieve this goal, I invested all my energy and all my savings, and I also studied hard. I felt that at that time, as long as I wanted to do it, everything could be achieved.

So I want to create a perfect trading system that can predict future market trends, with a high success rate, good profit-loss ratio, small drawdown, and heavy trading, quickly doubling.

At that time, I watched some wealth myths every day. Whoever achieved richness because of trading, I fantasized every day that I could replicate this kind of success. At that time, I was so poor that I was watching Porsche every day.

**But how can there be any magical trading system?**

In those few years, I was in a mess. Fortunately, there are a few like-minded friends making deals. They are calmer than me. We have changed our expectations for transaction returns. From the initial expected doubling of 10 times to a stable 40%+annual interest rate, after several years of compound interest, we gradually have everything we want.

I remember it deeply. I have a very good friend by my side. He used 10,000 US dollars to trade in five days and made more than 40,000 US dollars. We often drink to celebrate. Within a few days, this friend disappeared, and no one has been contacted so far. He is said to have liquidated several accounts, including his relatives and friends.

Alas, life is impermanent, don't be greedy. Greed is the biggest loss

**Inner Demon 2：Fear**

The main reason for the poor execution of many people's transactions is due to fear.

What are the manifestations of fear in trading?

Optimistic about the market, afraid to open a position, afraid of losing money. The trading plan is clearly formulated, there are obvious rules for entering and exiting the market, and the capital is also a reasonable ratio. When the conditions for opening a position are met, they dare not click the button for opening a position. If you want to wait, you missed it.

We have the right trading funds, but we have made a profit but dare not hold positions. With the ups and downs of the market, afraid of profit taking, we rushed to close the position.

We can't stop losses, but it's also a manifestation of fear, fearing that if we lose money, we won't be able to make money back.

Our capital positions are getting smaller and smaller. In the futures trading, we finally opened our capital positions to 0.01 hand, but it was still tangled.

**There are many such examples, how to solve them?**

The fear in trading is mainly due to the face of unknown market conditions, we do not know the final profit and loss of the transaction.

Fear in the face of the unknown is human nature.

The best way to solve this problem is to turn an unknown profit and loss result into a predictable profit with a high probability.

How to do it specifically? That is to test the profitability of the trading system extensively.

The specific methods and cases to solve the fear psychology, because the number of words are too many, I will not repeat them one by one. Friends who are interested can communicate with me alone.

If you are a cryptocurrency business owner and receive an e-mail from Twitter stating ""Twitter Professional Profiles"" with a black button displaying ""Nominate your Business!"" Don't do it.

I made the mistake of applying for this as we have a very legitimate website for displaying cryptocurrency prices with technical analysis, with visual heatmaps etc.    We do not buy or sell crypto, we do not have a token that we try to sell.   Based on the rules stated by Twitter we are not in violation of any of them.

I filled out the Twitter Professional profile form, with phone numbers, addresses, business descriptions.   The first sign trouble was on the way was an e-mail stating I cannot run Twitter Ads as my account is not eligible for that.   Which was strange as I had not run a Twitter ad or tried to run a twitter ad.    This occurred about 12 hours after applying.

The next morning when I logged into Twitter I get the news that my account has been suspended, on the screen when logging in, for violating twitter rules.    No details of what rule I violated was provided.   Also I received no e-mail that my account was being suspended.

I have filed an appeal to this,   The first popup that occurs is text to the effect of ""Due to the large number of account suspension appeals, a review of your appeal may be delayed""

I believe them. 

But once the next wave of investors jump in, the higher we will go. By a huge magnitude. 

Some thoughts on how we get there: 

1. The killer one-sentence description of what it is. All the smart folks digesting the tech and white papers and ICO prospectii have helped the new folks like me find my sea legs (THANK YOU!!) But to get the broad investing public to feel safe about putting money in, they have to understand it better than how it’s being explained today. Explaining blockchain to people shouldn’t be a lesson in verbal gymnastics. 

2. The ease of use and widespread, everyday transacting. Once people see the platforms/networks/coins in action they’ll quickly be able to understand the underlying concepts and determine which coins are worth their investment. 

3. Regulatory clarity. In the US it’s any number of government agencies than can gum up the industry. Once the dust settles and they all decide what to do with crypto, that will help open the floodgates. 

4. Support from financial institutions. Of course this goes with #3, but once mutual funds and banks and credit card companies and FinTech dip in with more that just a few options, we will really take off.

I’ve recently gotten into crypto and have been trying to absorb as much knowledge/information as I can but am wondering what many of you do/what your strategies are. It would seem there are at least a handful of “popular” or “promising” coins including but not limited to: BTC, ETH, ADA, DOT, XTZ, ALGO &amp; XLM. 

I’m looking at this as a long term investment and the plan is DCA and hodl… however a couple things I’m still not totally sure about:

Is hodling a sound/effective strategy for all coins or just the bigger names like BTC and ETH?

How many different coins do you currently own/invest in? Do you think it’s better to pick 2-3 you really like/believe in or spread out the risk with like 5-8 coins?

Lastly since I’m late(r) to the game (or so it feels), does it make more sense to invest a larger percentage into the “proven”/big boys like BTC/ETH as they’re the safer bet, take more risk and invest more heavily in other projects with potential for greater growth or just spread things out evenly to keep my portfolio diverse?

Just trying to get an idea of how those of you who have been in the crypto world awhile approach things and what’s been successful for you.

## Ethereum

Ethereum slid by 7.08% on Tuesday. Following a 10.58% slide on Monday, Ethereum ended the day at $2,765.69.

A choppy start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning low $2,805.00.

Finding support at the first major support level at $2,810, Ethereum rose to a late morning intraday high $3,104.82.

Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $3,245, however, Ethereum slid to a late intraday low $2,651.00.

Ethereum fell through first major support level at $2,810 and the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 before a partial recovery to $2,760 levels.

At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.46% to $2,778.35.  A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning low $2,756.72 before rising to a high $2,791.00.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

### For the day ahead

Ethereum would need to move through the $2,841 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $3,030 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $3,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $3,294.

Failure to move through the $2,841 pivot would bring the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 and the first major support level at $2,576 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2,500 levels. The second major support level sits at $2,389.

## Litecoin

Litecoin fell by 5.50% on Tuesday. Following a 10.55% slide on Monday, Litecoin ended the day at $148.52.

After a choppy start to the day, Litecoin rose to a late morning intraday high $162.32 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $171, Litecoin slid to a late intraday low $144.60.

The reversal saw Litecoin fall through the first major support level at $148 before a partial recovery to $148 levels.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.16% to $148.28. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin fall to an early morning low $147.85 before rising to a high $149.35.

Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

### For the day ahead

Litecoin would need to move through the $152 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $159 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Litecoin to break out from $155 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $162.32 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of another breakout, Litecoin could test the second major resistance level at $170.

Failure to move through the $152 pivot would bring the first major support level at $141 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$140. The second major support level sits at $134.

## Ripple’s XRP

Ripple’s XRP fell by 5.22% on Tuesday. Following a 12.16% tumble on Monday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.87352.

A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall to an early morning low $0.86287 before making a move.

Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $0.8533 and the major support levels, Ripple’s XRP rose to a mid-day intraday high $0.95887.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $1.0223, Ripple’s XRP slid to a late intraday low $0.85800.

Continuing to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $0.8533 and major support levels, however, Ripple’s ended the day at $0.87 levels.

At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.14% to $0.87471. A mixed start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall to an early morning low $0.87168 before rising to a high $0.88279.

### For the day ahead

Ripple’s XRP would need to move through the $0.8968 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $0.9356 into play. Support would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to move back through to $0.90 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $0.95887 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP could test the second major resistance level at $0.9977.

Failure to move through $0.8968 pivot would bring the 23.6% FIB of $0.8533 and the first major support level at $0.8347 into play.

The most commonly used charts are candlestick, bar, and line charts. Each can be created with similar data but presents the information in different and useful ways. Some of the most common technical indicators are:

Average directional index: A technical analysis indicator that helps determine the strength of a trend

Bollinger bands: A tool used in technical analysis that helps determine whether asset prices are high or low on a relative basis

Relative strength index (RSI): A momentum indicator used in technical analysis to determine the magnitude of recent price changes

Standard deviation: A concept applied to an investment’s annual rate of return; provides insight into that investment's historical volatility

These indicators can help investors and traders in their quest to exact profits from trends. Other statistical tools that investors may turn to when leaning on bitcoin technical analysis include moving averages/RSI/MACD, Fibonacci ratios, volume weighted average price (VWAP), and time-weighted average price (TWAP).

At its core, technical analysis is basic economics wrapped in fancy terms; essentially, it’s the study of supply and demand and the way to best anticipate trends.

As regulatory concerns over the crypto industry grow, the Biden administration has taken a tough stance towards cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, September 21, his administration sanctioned a crypto exchange to cut off revenue to ransomware groups.

The crypto exchange, Suex, was accused by regulators of doing business with hackers behind eight types of ransomware. As a result of the sanction, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Gary Gensler, opined that there is little long-term viability for cryptocurrencies. Gensler went further to compare stablecoins pegged to the USD to ‘poker chips.’

## PayPal’s Super App is Here, Kraken Adds Support for Apple, Google Pay

As the race for full crypto integration intensifies among fintechs, PayPal has teased a “Super App.” However, users do not have to wait much longer, as the first official version of that app has been introduced.

PayPal’s super app combines traditional financial tools, including “direct deposit, bill pay, a digital wallet, peer-to-peer payments, shopping tools, crypto capabilities and more.” In addition, PayPal has announced a partnership with Synchrony Bank to bring a new high-yield savings account, PayPal Savings.

As more platforms warm up to the crypto industry, Kraken has upgraded its app, adding Apple Pay and Google Pay support. Kraken users can now buy cryptocurrencies on its app using Apple and Google Pay.

With the upgrade, users’ existing Apple Pay or Google Pay accounts are connected to the app for faster payments.

## Avalanche’s Vee Finance Suffers $35 Million Hack

Decentralized Finance, DeFi, seeks to recreate traditional financial systems, such as banks and exchanges, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access any global currency, get loans, and earn yields on deposits.

Unfortunately, as their popularity increases, so have the number of breaches on DeFi platforms. The latest victim is Vee Finance, a decentralized lending protocol on Avalanche. On September 21, Vee Finance announced that a $35 million hack had hit the platform.

According to the announcement, the cyber thief made away with 8,804 ETH and 214 BTC from its trade contract address. The team is currently working with developers to identify the bugs in the protocol.

Now there has been a housing boom in China. That boom might be crashing in front of us. Many are over leveraged and will not be able to pay their bills. When/ if this happens the second largest economy in the world will have serious issues and spending will slow down. (Simplified) 

If this happens the global economy will be affected and that includes the crypto markets.  Start thinking ahead in all areas of your finances. Try to have 6 months of savings. It might get a lot worse before it gets better.

I called my bank, Chase Bank, and within 1 hour they resolved it.  To be honest I was at the end of my fuse at the point I called them, it was a last ditch, I was getting fucked.  They came through, and they didn’t charge me a typical 30$ stop billing fee AND recovered some money.

This was at 6pm the day of the Chinese dip.  I wanted to use the money that I rightfully recovered to buy some more DOT and ETH, but I was worried that the wire would take a while and I’d miss the dip.  I initiated it at 8am the next morning and the money was cleared on my exchange by 830a.

I am between:

 iTrustCapitol - [https://itrustcapital.com/](https://itrustcapital.com/)  \- Low cost, favorite for lots of people I have seen discuss this and good selection of Coins they update regularly. It seems like trading is done on their own platform/pools instead of an exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken. I may be wrong though. Allows investing into precious metals like Gold as well (not interested in this).

&amp;#x200B;

DirectedIRA - [https://directedira.com/cryptocurrency/](https://directedira.com/cryptocurrency/) \- Costs seem competitive and you get a Gemini account for trading. Also can set up a self directed LLC option that lets you do trading on exchanges as you see fit and hold your own cryptos in your wallet etc. Seems like a smaller company but they put out good educational info. 

&amp;#x200B;

Choice by Kingdom Trust - [https://www.retirewithchoice.com/](https://www.retirewithchoice.com/) \- Leaning toward them for now. Exchange account is built on Kraken primarily . You can swap between crypto and stocks seamlessly it looks like? Competitive cost... may be the cheapest option overall. Have options for leaving on exchange, cold storage through Fidelity Digital Assets, or self holding your keys. 

I saw a post of an interview on Youtube where at least 1 of the companies said that they now allow staking to be enabled but have to call in to request the change on account. Can not find documentation on any sites though I believe it was iTrustCapitol? Choice customer service responded and said that they are working on allowing staking but don't have a specific date.

Who has had positive or negative experiences with these companies and/or are there others you would recommend I look into? 

Any that let you stake inside their platform (instead of going the checkbook/LLC path)?

Backstory:  

April 2021, my friend, Brad, invested a significant amount of money with the crypto broker [RoyalBC-FM.com](https://RoyalBC-FM.com).   Over the next 4 months he worked closely with their brokers (Michael Romano, Michael Green and James Martinez) to buy and sell Bitcoin.  All seemed on the up and up, until Brad decided to sell and cash out.  He paid a number of fees to release the funds  (on top of his original investment), they sold the coins, sent the money to another wallet and have completely ghosted him.  It has been a month and I seriously fear for Brad's health and well-being.   He is currently in the hospital as his family feared for the worst.  

details:

* The money was wired from his bank account (TD Canada Trust) to a Bitvo account in Canada.
* RoyalBC-FM created and controlled the Bitvo account on his behalf.

I trade crypto daily using centralised exchanges and peer2peer exchanges, i trade purely for myself as an individual to build up my personal portfolio. This is also my only income at the moment. I'm not bragging but my volume is quite high (I wont share specifics for obvious reasons). 

I use one bank for my crypto activities and another for my day to day life (bills and stuff). The bank I use for my crypto trading is called Rabobank, this is a dutch bank. Today a lady from this bank called me to ask me to stop immediately with what I am doing or they will block my account. This because the activity on my account seems more like business related (there is a lot of activity due to arbitrage between exchanges etc). I asked them if in that case i could switch to a business account (even though I am doing this as an individual). They told me they do not open accounts for crypto related businesses....

This is not the first time a bank has called me regarding my crypto activities, but this is the first time they told me to stop it. On previous occasions the banks would merely suggest that crypto is high risk and maybe not a good idea. But this bank just blatantly told me to quit what I am doing. They basically told me to stop making a living the way i am doing it now. I do not know how you would react to that but that one really triggered me and i told the lady what she would say if someone would call her and tell her to quit her job(maybe a bit childish but i was really triggered)?

I was under the impression that I live in a country with lots of personal freedom (the Netherlands). But if it is up to Rabobank they would gladly impede on this personal freedom of mine to do whatever I want with MY money (as long as it is not illegal) by excluding me from the banking system.

I know this seems like a rant and maybe it is but I am very pissed of at this. I can not believe that they had the audacity to tell me and force me to spend my money differently.

I contacted several lawyers, and the basic gist is that banks can do whatever they want. With the new anti money laundering rules in Europe banks are under pressure from the government to do their due diligence. This legislation comes at the cost of people like me, people who make money in a non traditional way. I am basically guilty until proven innocent because the bank does not have the capability to check wether all my transactions are legit or not.

This move from Rabobank has me a little bit worried for the future of crypto in Europe.

I recently received my coinbase card and have been considering using that instead of our main rewards card which is our Costco card.  I'm trying to figure out if we should stick with an average cashback of 1.5% (Costco) or put that into crypto for a possible greater return.   We pay our card off in full every month.

[Screenshots for Coinbase rewards and our YTD Costco rewards](https://imgur.com/a/8DZ10ET)

We've spent about $50k this year which is about double our normal spending because we replaced our HVAC and are in the middle of a kitchen reno.  If I only looked at what bitcoin did over this last year which is +300%, then that $500 in BTC 1% is now $2000, more than 3x the $700 we have YTD from Costco, but obviously that growth is from the start and as we spend throughout the year so does BTC rise (usually).

The other thing to consider is because it's debit I might need to constantly monitor the amount of cash in there which could get annoying.  Unless of course I choose to pay using Tezos (not USD) and keep money in Tezos which also earns 4.63% APY, which could be a benefit while the money sits there waiting to be spent....so now I'm getting more confused. :-)

So anyway, I'm having a hard time with all the different options.  If anyone has a better way to present a comparison of returns to me so that I could look at it and propose the switch to my wife, I would love to see it!

Side note:  This is actually the first time I've really looked at the amount we've spent, as normally I'm only seeing it month to month.

I recently started DCAing into BTC once again but seeing the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index mentioned quite often in the Daily has got me wondering how my fixed monthly buys actually fare against buying based on the F&amp;G Index. Thankfully, their website allows you to export historical data going back to 1 Feb 2018 so I was able to play around with the data to gather some findings. Bitcoin's daily closing price is from CoinGecko.

First of all, let's find some benchmarks based on the traditional weekly and monthly DCA buys. I decided to separate the results based on different yearly timeframes: 2021 only (YTD), 2020 only, 2019 only, and 2018 only (Feb-Dec); as well as looking at longer timeframes: 2020-2021, 2019-2021, and 2018-2021. As September is still ongoing, YTD data is based on Jan-Aug but current value is calculated based on the 21 Sep price.

Here are the results for weekly DCAs based on a particular day of the week:

Based on the data here, Friday followed by Wednesday appear to be the best day to DCA although the differences between each day of the week are negligible when looking at longer timeframes.

Below are the results for monthly DCAs based on a fixed date of each month.

For monthly DCAs, Day 1 and Day 13 have performed the best since 2018. *Note that months without days 29-31, the last day of the month was used instead.*

Taking the top two choices for weekly and monthly, looks like monthly edges out weekly a little bit.

Next is my analysis of the Fear &amp; Greed Index and how we could potentially take advantage of it to maximize our BTC gains. Logically, the best time to buy is when there's blood in the streets so according to the index, that would be Extreme Fear. I looked at a number of buy strategies that I came up with:

* Buy only on the first day the index changes to Extreme Fear
* Buy every single day the index shows Extreme Fear
* Buy every two days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every three days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every four days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every five days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every six days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every seven days on Extreme Fear

Basically, when you get X consecutive days of Extreme Fear, you would continue buying at that specific interval you've chosen. When the F&amp;G is no longer in Extreme Fear mode, the above rules reset. I also tested the same based on buying on Fear OR Extreme Fear, which of course should be the less favorable option but give you more buying opportunities. Below are the results.

https://preview.redd.it/a4jfaffxo1p71.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3485ed3a44b077057ad842bee06794599e94d512

Buying every five days when the index is at Extreme Fear appears to be the outright winner here. The clear outlier is the *Extreme Fear (Every 7 Days)* in 2019 where it returned only 0.77% when the other strategies were able to achieve 30%+. This is because there was only one instance of seven consecutive days of Extreme Fear so you were only limited to one buying opportunity in the whole of 2019.

As you can see, based on historical data, buying the dip based on the Fear &amp; Greed Index versus casually DCAing on a weekly or monthly basis will undoubtedly result in better ROI. However, buying opportunities will be more scarce so extreme patience will be necessary when applying this strategy.

Finally, I understand that we're just looking at somewhat limited data from only Feb 2018 and it might be better if more data was available going back to 2013 or earlier. On the other hand, 2018-2021 could also be a better representation of today's market and it also includes a lengthy bear market as well as the recent/current bull market.

Having a fixed DCA schedule is undoubtedly the easiest option and will still give you great returns but you could effectively time the market a little bit by using the publicly available Fear &amp; Greed Index to maximize those gains.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3492437,public,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NUtWquGtUTaN6ZdnPkjrWF-aFbi2-glEdcAsXVM6fCk.jpg,"Weekly vs. Monthly vs. ""Extreme Fear"" DCA Comparisons - Using the Fear &amp;

Well, isn't it convenient that you can just say that and blatantly ignore the reasons why the Shanghai index didn't crash today? China pumped 18.6 billion USD today into their banking system to calm potential contagion fears, while Evergrande's largest subsidiary announced that they would be able to make coupon payments on their onshore bonds (which is by far their largest amount of debt). All of this happened today, after the markets opened. If you bothered to look, you can actually see that the Shanghai index actually took a massive dump in the morning before these announcements. 

Just because these things happened today, doesn't make those that were warning about a potential black swan wrong. Market conditions changed. People would really be better served knowing more about these things than acting like the broader economy doesn't affect crypto, as much as we want that to be true.

I was hoping we could all work together to create an exhaustive list of known scamming methods to watch out for, especially for newbies. A bestiary of crypto monsters if you will. 
I am not an expert by any means so please correct me if I get the logistics of a particular scam wrong or you have a more in-depth solution. I’ll edit in any additions the community deems necessary as well as any solutions/steps to protect oneself. Some of these things may seem obvious for many but I wanted to make no assumptions about the level of knowledge of the readers. Thank you in advance to anyone who contributes. 

The Dusting Attack:
The little bits of left over crypto after you do a transaction is referred to as dust. 

Scammers use the fact that most people don’t keep track of this by sending small amounts of crypto to thousands of wallets and track what happens to this dust that they sent your wallet. They can analyze where they are sent and establish connections to narrow down who the owner of the wallet is. They are then able to target the owner with some of the other techniques on this list with Phishing, Ransomware, or social engineering. 

Solution: Don’t touch it. You have internet asthma and dust coming from somewhere unknown will cause an asthma attack. Do not interact with it

Fake Wallets:

Fake wallets online or in-app stores that eventually steal all of the funds.

Solution: DYOR. This is unavoidable. Do your homework. Do not download a crypto wallet Willy-nily from the play store. Even Apple who touts a secure app environment isn’t 100% safe from these type of scams. 
Consider using a hardware wallet. 

The Fraudulent ICO
ICO stands for initial coin offering. This can be one of the toughest scams to see thru because they typically have sweet talkers marketing the coin and building hype before they pull the rug and ride into the night with your crypto. 

Solution: Be on the lookout for these things or a combination of these red flags.
1. Look to make sure their white paper isn’t copy pasta’d. 
2. Much of the team in charge is anonymous
3. They have a rushed timeline/no roadmap
4. Ignores difficult questions/criticisms
5. Weak use case or tokenomics


The Malware Variants:

Keylogging Malware:
Designed to capture your login credentials or spending passwords to gain access to your account. 

Solution: Be careful browsing sketchy sites. Use anti malware software like Malwarebytes 

Copy Paste Malware:
Code that makes your clipboard paste the scammers address instead of whatever address of yours you copied. 

Solution: Always be diligent in making sure the address is correct. Yes this is tedious but could save you some serious heartache. Use anti malware like Malwarebytes

The SIM Hacking:
Hackers transfer your cellphone number to a new phone. They then use that phone to pose as you and reset the password for your crypto wallet to access and steal all of your funds

Solution: 
1. Set up a PIN or password on your cellular account
2. Limit how much information you share online
3. Don’t reply to spam texts, emails, calls asking for personal details

The Nigerian Prince/Hot Crypto Expert
Usually comes in the form of direct messages offering their services to help you get rich with a small fee for their services.

The dull ache of yesterday's booze made consciousness unappealing as Derek sought an early night, with the heavy curtains shielding the 7pm sunlight. Closing the bedroom door to help block out the foul scent of unwashed dishes and dirty laundry, Derek was still tormented with his whisky-scented perspiration. ""At least I can sleep in the bed again"" Derek muttered to himself, fading out of consciousness.

2 weeks had passed since Anna had left with the kid and he had not received but a single letter. Derek had finally sold a number of his alt coins in the wake of the Evergrande dip. A significant loss of course but now the lights were back on in the house as Derek had at least some fiat.

Anna had made her way to Newcastle to stay with her sister. The arguments with Derek had become unbearable and, worried of the effects on young Anthony, she had decided to take a break from Derek. Leaving without warning was perhaps not the most noble thing to do, but Derek had took to the bottle and another argument with drunk, belligerent Derek was, well, unappealing.

Derek, unaware of Anna and Anthony's whereabouts, fell further into his pit, the colour leaving him a little more each day. But he could still show her... As angry as the Evergrande dip had made him, ridding himself of his Doge, even at such a remarkable loss, was oddly liberating. It was Sunday morning and Derek had a new lease of life. The weight of his Doge and his anxiety around Elon Musk's next tweet had evaporated. ""Bitcoin it is"" thought Derek, launching a large portion of his left over cash into his sure thing.

Anna will come back to a new man"".",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3492375,public,self,The trials and tribulations of Derek and his Doge,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pt8nvr/the_trials_and_tribulations_of_derek_and_his_doge/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this sub, this is quite a challenge, but let me try anyway. 

September has definitely been a cool-down compared to the steep rush of late July / August. The market climbed some more, but the momentum did ultimately dissipate and we were dropping before Evergrande gave us something to argue about. The fact is, there was a big drawdown and after a couple of months in the doldrums, a big surge back up, followed by some fairly rational profit taking (I, however am not rational so I took no profits. Meh) and we are now where we are. 

I remember thinking by mid-August about how the surge came too soon and how I'd have wished to fill my bags for a bit longer before it shot straight up, and lo and behold, the chance has presented itself. 

I'm still mostly just buying and HODL-ing, but at least there are a couple more DCA's now at a lower price point, and if things go as they often do, October and the rest of the year will quite possibly be another run-up, so what we can (safely and responsibly!) put in now at these prices will just add to the gains when they do come. 

Who knows? Maybe I'll even learn to take some profits or something! 

Anyway the point is, whether it's Evergrande, or Gensler, or Elon, or Ape pixel art, it doesn't matter. We're in a pullback that's higher than the lows of June, and we have a chance to buy some more good projects at less absurdly inflated prices before they become even more absurdly inflated again soon.

*How might I increase engagement with those businesses?* 

*Should I tweak the onboarding email title/content?*

*Should the onboarding email have a different kind of call-to-action than simply asking people to sign up for my website and claim their listing?*

*Should I cold call them or send them video messages on IG/FB and let them know that they’ve been added to my website?*

1) Choose a general Mechanism
General mechanisms are the protocols that consider a particular transaction legitimate and add to the block.

2) Choose a Blockchain Platform.
The apt choice of blockchain platform for your currency all boils down on the general mechanism you’ve selected.

3) Design The Nodes
You have to decide the workings and functionality of your blockchain and design the nodes step by step. Schematic questions to be put into consideration here are ; 
• Will the permission be Public or Private ?
• Will the hosting will be on the cloud or on-premises, or both? 
• What would be the required hardware details for the execution?

4) Establish Blockchain’s Private Structure 
Be sure about all the aspects before the launch as you won’t be able to change several parameters of the blockchain after it’s launched and running. The decisions could be as simple as what address format your blockchain will follow to providing exchanges between different cryptocurrencies without a 3rd party intermediary.

5) Integrate APIs
Some platforms don’t provide pre-built APIs so make sure yours does. If it doesn’t still no need to worry, there are several 3rd party blockchain API providers like ChromaWay, Gem, Colu, Bitcore, BlockCypher, and Tierion.

6) Design The Interface
Building a world-class cryptocurrency is of no use if your interface is not good. You need to make sure that the web, FTP servers, and external databases are of most recent and the front-end and back-end programming is done with the future upgrades in mind.

7) Make Your Cryptocurrency Legal
Make sure that your cryptocurrency is prepared and abiding by the soon to become laws of international cryptocurrency regulations. This way your work is preserved and no sudden surprises can ruin your efforts in creating a new cryptocurrency.

Not to mention the stress of having to report these trades as well, holy shit I get 5. grade math exam PTSD just thinking about it. You're seriously gonna do that with 5-20 different coins a year from now?? 

As I see it, it's all coinflips whether the market goes up or down, and with day trading you have to flip at least twice to win: once when calling the sell, and again on when to buy back - with an extra house handicap of needing at least a big enough drop to make up for taxes, no thanks. 

If the market dumps my trading friends sit on stop losses and buy alerts and never go more than 5 steps from a computer, while I get a nice big break from checking my port every minute, and calmly window shop for which coins to throw some fiat into at this amazing sale, all the while accumulating on interest and staking.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the impression that the US government seems to hate crypto for several reasons. 

Would government acceptance/adoption aid crypto?

What utility could crypto provide that would tip it over the edge of the skeptical majority?

- Would blockchain usage in fields such as police/emergency medical teams/hospitals aid in crypto’s future?

With the crypto market steadily accumulating after the may dip, I would personally say we will be growing back to the second leg of this bull run, and thus get a lot of newcomers along the way. With a lot of information being posted on this subreddit, it's sometimes impossible to see the wood for the trees. Newcomers will look for information on YouTube, Reddit, Google and even TikTok (although this leads to a lot of FUD/Pump&amp;Dump influencers).

Furthermore, a lot of us have steady daily jobs to obtain FIAT to transfer to them sweet sweet crypto. We don't have a lot of free time to research and study crypto. 

# This is where Podcasts can become useful in time management. 

At least.. if you find the right ones. 

I’ve listened to the first 3 episodes of dozens of podcasts to inform you which one might fill your head with useful knowledge of the cryptoverse. 

3 Podcasts that have quality content in my opinion (in random order) and what makes them applicable:

&amp;#x200B;

## Podcast 1: Unchained

Unchained is a crypto podcast hosted by Laura Shin: a crypto and blockchain journalist. She has an extensive history in crypto, in fact, as the former senior editor of Forbes, she was the first mainstream reporter to cover crypto assets full-time.

The podcast comes in a weekly, hour-long format. Episodes feature interviews with some of the main players in the cryptocurrency space, including founders, CEOs and attorneys. 

Topics range from personal tales of how individuals got involved with crypto, investment advice, taxes, security and more.

&amp;#x200B;

## Podcast 2: Crypto 101

If you’re looking for a podcast that will help you learn the basics, Crypto 101 might be for you. It’s hosted by Bryce Paul, a business developer in the crypto space, and Aaron Malone, a crypto advisor (do watch out when someone calls himself a financial advisor, not my choice of words) and researcher. 

Each episode of the podcast tackles a specific topic related to cryptocurrency.

This weekly podcast varies in length, so you can plan to spend anywhere from 25 minutes to over an hour listening, depending on the episode

&amp;#x200B;

## Podcast 3: Crypto Radio

Crypto Radio is a podcast that covers a wide range of topics, from blockchain and bitcoin to crypto investing, technology developments and more. It’s hosted by 4 individuals who are full-time investors and entrepreneurs in the crypto field. Much like other podcasts, their conversations can be humoristic like a group of friends discussing worldly topics. 

It’s apparently broken apart in a few different series (I only listened to 3 episodes of the podcast):

· Introduction to Crypto Investing 

· Thought Leader Series (These episodes allow you to get insights from some of the top people in the field about fascinating topics, including the future of the crypto space)

· The Founder series (focuses more on the practical use of the companies and applications that are featured by the guests. Some examples include the Stack digital wallet and Fitchain.)

And when that discussion came to an end (not a conclusion tho), one person raised the question about copyright of the creator. In my jurisdiction you can become the owner of something and might still not be allowed to publish it online for example, as a means to protect the creator and their rights. It all depends on the agreement you have reached with the original creator.

My thought was that technically, as soon as you mint an NFT, you publish the creation (or a link to the creation) on the blockchain. This could be considered a violation of copyright, as you make the creation available to the public. 

So my question is: is there any way you could think of that we could mint an NFT which proves the ""ownership"" of one person over a creation while being able to hide what that creation is or looks like?

Could we just encrypt the link to the creation in the metadata or make the link lead to a password-protected database? But how would the encryption key/password be passed on then? and how can we (the public, that should not have trust individuals bc everything is open to the public on a blockchain) make sure that said NFT represents what it is said to represent?

We received a call from a person claiming to be from Coinberry. Obviously it wasn't, because they're a Canadian company and the call came from a +44 number. I spoke with a friend who suspects that the people running the scam are claming to be from Coinberry and ATBCrypto to facilitate their scam. I've logged into his accounts on both platforms and updated the passwords so they no longer have access.

When I logged into the ATBCrypto account, [this is what I saw.](https://i.imgur.com/WKCRSUe.png) I think what the scammers were doing was playing on my father's ignorance and telling him that all of these numbers add up to what he's owned to possibly convince him to send them their ""commission fee.""

Seeing as how there's a balance, is it possible to make a wallet with a legitimate company and transfer it out?

Please feel free to use/modify. The time to act is now. Let Congress know you vote on crypto!

Dear &lt;representative&gt;,

I am writing to voice my opposition to the very strict and overbearing regulations that will be placed on innovation and free enterprise should Bill H.R.4741 become law. 

The US is already behind China in the development of an electronic currency. By stifling existing and new cryptocurrency projects with heaps of red tape and compliance, the US risks losing this race for the future of money. 

I am not opposed to the proper regulation of cryptocurrency, however, I believe that the space is still widely misunderstood by the public and Congress. When people use terms like “shadow bank” or “wild West casino money” they are playing on fears or they themselves misunderstand the transparency and security related to blockchain. Developed and established blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum are functional, transparent, and decentralized. The use of stablecoins, so long as they are backed by sufficient dollar reserves, allows for security and fast/transparent and low-cost transfers of funds. Furthermore, as these technologies flourish, so long as they are properly regulated, they will promote the US dollar as the world reserve currency. 

I could go on. I vote on innovation and the economy. I encourage you to promote the study and contemplation of blockchain technologies before voting to stifle development and innovation in this field with overbearing legislation. In this respect, the US will remain the technological leader of the free world. 

Thank you!

Yet they still use them wholeheartedly. This CCP bs proves it.

So many losses accrued by foolish retail investors panic selling. For what? A corrupt investment scheme from the world's largest exporter of evil and inhumanity. Those retail investors drive prices down and force the swing traders to bail out early.

The Federal Reserve, dogmatic big government politicians, legacy finance experts, all get to go on TV and say ""See? Crypto is soooo unstable. You just can't trust it."" I'm not trying to say the sky is falling, I am saying that this proves a few things.

1. We ARE STILL EARLY. We, most of us, know that the purpose of crypto is to replace fiat. It is to force corrupt politicians out of our currency. It is to truly, give power to the people. Retail investors are looking for a quick buck, we're left hoping they come back.

2. There is no government on the face of the earth that will ever have our best interests at heart. So many times in this sub I read comments and posts where people still do not get this fact. It is as plain as the nose on your face. Breaking that paradigm could be a true key to mass adoption.

3. Legacy finance is slow to the adoption of its own survival. Yes there are obvious and glaring examples of the opposite. I think those examples to be the exceptions that prove the rule. People have failed to learn from the examples of history, that motivations for one person's act is motivating another to act differently.

4. I think all this means is we should keep our powders dry. Find our opportunities to grow, and recognize that we're not simply to be our own banks.

As a Joke, entertain the notion that it is more appropriate to get insight from a Comedian than a financial adviser. If you watch Stewart Lee's (appropriately named) ""Shilbottle"" routine.  The comedy of this skit is that the repetition of a joke is cyclic, causing initial humor followed by irritation, followed by annoyance only to become even more hilarious than it was to begin with.

For myself, the coin I bought near the ATH was VeChain as many others did when it was one of the main things being talked about on this group.   


However, I have always been very bullish on this coin and continue to believe in it to this day. A very long-term hold. Anyway, below is a show of just how much my portfolio changed after I purchased the dip when everything first started going down and then a few hours ago as well:   


[Average buy at $0.131 USD after dip purchases](https://preview.redd.it/gt990dy4n1p71.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fccd5cffb27f7ed14ebad55258b47af663d5d14)

My first purchase went from an average buy of **$0.250 USD** (0.210 Euro/0.18 Pounds) all the way down to **$0.131 USD** (0.11 Euro/0.096 Pounds) which is really awesome. I didn't think about it much until I remembered my exchange had a purchased coin tracker with graphs like this. 

Of course, if you are holding a large amount of, for example, $1000 then averaging down with smaller purchases (during dips) of $100 - $200 won't make as much as a difference as my purchases (which were both the same size as the original one) but it still makes a noticeable difference. Here is a visualization. 

When you purchased your first coin at a higher price: 

[Average buy is starting at $1000](https://preview.redd.it/1n24ivnxp1p71.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aef2976f26e463bf1c91ddab821f3e90b7538229)

Then you purchase the 11% dip with $200 and the further 13% dip with $200 again:

[$1000 average buy dropped to $962](https://preview.redd.it/gbf91o5xq1p71.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2e29e15cfc9c3bb7618a6d5928fb5ce04fb0b33)

 If you only purchased with $100 per dip instead of $200 it would look like this:   


[Average buy of $1000 goes down to $977](https://preview.redd.it/c8x92318r1p71.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d3011353b712c533079a8c3dcb42c49f6ecf6f5)

Might not seem like a lot to some people, but just by buying during a dip you are now able to profit $38 (at 2x $200 purchases) or $23 (at 2x $100 purchases). If you do this often with dips, it all adds up. 

Keep in mind, if you truly believe in the project and think it can go x2 (just an example) then the $38/$23 will turn into $76/$46. 

Personally, I like to combine that with staking most of my coins as well as DCA. I purchase Crypto every week (manually) and if I see that during one week that the market has gone down 10%+ then I will buy in then instead of just having an automatic weekly purchase (which is really great as well, brilliant returns for growing coins).

Their main objective is to protect and validate data integrity. It is a part of the consensus algorithm that is used in that particular blockchain. These hashes or digest which is the output of the hashing function are primarily used for comparison and not encryption.

**In a blockchain network**, the data of the transactions which is stored in the blocks will have to be hashed, to validate the integrity of the network. The input in the hash function will be the transactional data that takes place inside the network, then the data is hashed and then stored in the block as a string in a fixed size depending on the type of hash function that is used.

The hashing function of a blockchain network depends on the consensus algorithm of the network.  
There are different versions of hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, etc.

[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) network that leverages a two-tiered structure and a unique variation of the [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus mechanism to increase transaction speeds and achieve finality. Algorand’s block rewards are distributed to all ALGO coin holders, offering all ALGO holders an opportunity to earn rewards instead of just block producers.    

Algorand is a decentralized network built to solve the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition) of achieving speed, security, and decentralization simultaneously. It is a permissionless and open-source blockchain network upon which anyone can build. Algorand is designed to be a payments-focused network with rapid transactions and a strong focus on achieving near-instant finality — that means processing over 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) and achieving transaction finality in less than five seconds.     

As a public smart contract blockchain that relies on staking, Algorand is currently capable of hosting decentralized application (dApp) development and providing scalability. Rising [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) on Ethereum have led many dApp developers and [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) traders to look for alternative blockchain solutions, with some turning to Algorand as an Ethereum-alternative for dApp development and DeFi applications.

###Inception    

Launched in June 2019 by computer scientist and MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is a permissionless and open-source blockchain network upon which anyone can build.    

A non-profit organization called the Algorand Foundation oversees the funding and development of Algorand Inc. and the Algorand protocol itself. The Algorand Foundation supports developer education in universities and educational settings. Its Global University Program includes prestigious universities like MIT, UC Berkeley, and other leading institutions around the world. 

###Technology    

Algorand uses a [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus mechanism, and distributes validator rewards to all holders of its native ALGO [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). Through strong throughput capacity and equitable community incentivization, Algorand is capable of managing the high-throughput requirements of widespread global usage and a variety of use cases.     

Algorand has a unique two-tiered [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) structure. The base layer supports [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract), asset creation, and [atomic swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp) between assets. All of these processes take place on Layer 1 of the Algorand blockchain, which helps ensure security and compatibility.     

The second layer of Algorand is reserved for more complex smart contracts and dApp development. It’s this bifurcation of the network, between Layer 1 and Layer 2, that allows Algorand to process transactions so efficiently. With more complex smart contracts taking place off-chain, simple transactions can be processed more quickly on Layer 1 without being bogged down by larger, more complex smart contracts.

I am lurking for a long time here and reading most of the posts. I have learned a lot here so thanks for that. This is my first post here so i hope i am doing everything right.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this:

I have invested into different projects over the last \~ 6 months. My portfolio consists of 

ETH, ADA, FTM, XRP, AVAX, LINK, DOT, CKB and ONE

ETH is my biggest holding with \~50% of my money. The other 50% are split pretty equally over the other coins (FTM has a little bit more then the others)

Does it make more sense to invest additonal money into the same projects after a dip like this or would it be better to get into other projects i like e.g. MATIC, HBAR, SOL, COTI...

I am not sure if it is better to bring the avarage price of my buyings down or to keep expanding my portfolio if lets say i am expecting a similar growth of ADA and MATIC in the future.

I hope the question is understandable.

# What is a Digital Wallet?

Similar to fiat currencies, digital currencies need to be managed and stored somewhere. As we keep dollar bills securely in a wallet so do we need to store our digital currencies like Bitcoin in wallets.

A digital wallet refers to a smart electronic device or a software program that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online. This can include sending-receiving digital currencies or purchasing items with a computer, tablet, smartphone or any other smart device. A digital wallet uses software for proving authenticity of device/user, based on information stored in device itself. So a digital wallet has both a software and information component inside it. The software in combination with information like password, pin or a master key provides required minimal security and encryption for online transactions. There are two types of digital wallets available in the market: One is operated at client side or user side, where private keys are stored on user device itself. Another type of digital wallet can be maintained at server side and private keys are usually stored on the service provider server or exchange. The latter one is slightly easier to operate for end user as most of the setup hassle is handled by the exchange. Let us explore these digital wallets further.

# Crypto Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins, basically, a master key (private key to be more specific). These are special digital wallets used to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin etc and sometimes also called as Crypto Wallets. Like normal wallets, one can add, send or receive digital currencies from crypto wallets using private keys. These private keys/master keys are generated using strong cryptographic algorithms. This master key is used to authenticate a device/person identity to a wallet system. Once user identity is verified only then can someone make crypto transactions. Usually private keys are made up of alphanumeric strings of different lengths. A cryptocurrency wallet stores public and private key combination, which can be used to buy or send the cryptocurrency from your address to new address. A wallet can contain multiple pairs of public and private keys.

# How Does it Actually Work?

Cryptocurrency transactions work much like a traditional banking system and needs to trust on third party service providers usually a cryptocurrency exchange or a miner, in case you are not running a full node. This third party exchange/miner keeps record of all cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain, acting as a fully functional digital ledger. These service providers have huge computation power and charge a nominal fee for operational cost coverage.

Unlike banking systems these crypto systems are decentralized and all work in a democratic way, by majority agreement. Service providers usually link the individual wallet to their core wallet. So just like with a bank for debit or credit card, the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Even though crypto wallets are extremely safe, sometimes due to poor management of private keys by exchanges, hackers can trick system to steal user’s cryptocurrencies. This happened in the case of Mt. Gox exchange hacking in Japan, where exchange lost most of their clients’ bitcoins in a single hack incident.

Similar to how bank allocates a unique savings account number to a user, crypto exchanges assign a unique Digital Address (an alphanumeric string) and a unique Private Key to a user. This crypto address is just like your bank account number and can be shared publicly without any concerns of hacking. Only a person having access to private key of a digital address can view and operate transactions from that account. Private key is used for authentication during sending and receiving bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. On the other hand, access to the receiving wallet is not required for sending any cryptocurrency. Sender only needs to know the destination address and anyone can send cryptocurrency to that address.

If the private key of a crypto wallet is not compromised/leaked then it is almost impossible to break into your digital account. Its a well known fact that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA, has the highest computational power on earth. It is mathematically calculated that if all of NSA computational power is used even then it may take years to break into your digital account with brute force hacking method. These systems are so secure that if you forgot or lose the secret private key for your account then your bitcoins and cryptos are lost forever.

At present, there are four varieties of cryptocurrecy wallets widely in use.

# Web Wallet:

A web wallet is a web based service that allows users to store and control their private keys and other useful information at a service provider server. All crypto transactions are performed by using any standard web browser like Google Chrome. While using a web wallet user private keys are managed by a third party provider. Due to several Bitcoin and other crypto hacking incidents several exchanges have started providing two-factor-authentication (2FA) feature to their customers.

A common example of a web wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW). One can further visit [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) to know more about how this web wallet works. The most important thing to remember is, user should always make sure whether they are using the right URL/website and if the entire communication from your browser to server is encrypted using “https” protocol. If a website is not starting with https, always avoid it to create any accounts or send and receive any crypto currencies.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost.  
No need to carry an extra device while you are travelling or outside home.

**Cons:**  
Unsafe as hackers and keyloggers can hack your account and steal your funds.  
Difficult to transact on a public wifi.

# Software Wallet:

A software wallet is like any desktop application installed locally on your computer, or a mobile app installed on your Android or iOS based smart devices. For example, ImToken Mobile Wallet app is installed and used as we use any other app from Google Play or iPhone App stores. IMtoken is among the best software wallets with ample features supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. However, all software wallets might have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be used by hackers to perform illegal transactions from your digital wallet. With software wallet you have the option of using the same private key for your software wallet as well as web wallet. But for all cases securing your private key is utmost important.  
IMtoken is downloadable on both Android and iOS.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost as most apps are freely available.  
Much more secure than Web Wallet.

**Cons:**  
Require regular software updates with product version releases.  
For security reasons a user needs to remove all data related to app when changing or selling the device.

# Paper Wallet:

Paper wallets are yet another kind of wallets used for cryptocurrencies management. Individuals can print their digital addresses and private keys in the form of a QR code on a piece of paper. This piece of paper acts as a physical wallet and should be always kept at a safe place. Actually, it provides pretty good security as private key is stored offline and not vulnerable to hacking. However, this advantage is only applicable till private key is on paper. Once you enter the private key in a wallet to operate your transaction then it is equally vulnerable as is your underlying OS and software. Infact, there is additional hassle of entering private key again and again. Although one can use barcode reader but that again leaves a loophole in the safe operation of private key.

**Pros:**  
Easy to store and can be kept in a cupboard or a physical safe.  
Since it is stored offline its always protected from hackers.  
Its portable as it is much easy to carry paper and can be kept in a normal fiat wallet.

**Cons:**  
Can be easily destroyed intentionally or unintentionally.

# Hardware Wallet:

These days our computers and smart devices are always connected with internet. Each device usually have multiple apps, web browsers and softwares. These web browsers and apps can have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited by a seasoned hacker. Moreover, it was found from a survey that end users tend to ignore regular software updates, posing great risk to their device and investments. Its a possibility that private keys on an internet connected device are compromised. These are some of the loopholes exploited by hackers during several Bitcoin and other high value cryptocurrencies hacks.

Hardware wallet is the best existing solution to all of these hacking concerns, as user private key is never shared with anyone and never leaves the hardware device. When a hardware wallet performs a transaction, wallet’s software creates an encrypted value from the private key. This encrypted value is then shared with the remote device (or exchange) to complete authentication of the transaction. This way hardware wallet provides the best security among all digital wallets.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the best hardware wallet companies with a variety of products with different safety features. Both companies have created devices that require user to physically enter a pin by pressing button on the device to finally trigger the transaction. Some hardware wallets also have addition layer of security where user is required to enter a secret pin to open the hardware wallet. All these new safety devices and features have forced hackers to burn more midnight oil. If a user is taking all precautions then it is almost impossible to hack such devices by anyone.

**Pros:**  
Extremely secure as private keys are never exposed.  
Since it is a stand alone, separate device chances of virus infection are minimal.  
Devices have additional layer of security possible like pressing a button or pin entry.  
You can do transactions safely even on public wifi networks.  
Can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies.

**Cons:**  
Usually hardware wallets are expensive. A good hardware wallet can easily cost $100 plus.  
Device should always be with you to make any transaction.

It’s true no one can predict prices. No one. Not with technical analysis. Not through any fear-and-greed “index”, or Youtube “experts”, or crypto millionaires. There is no crystal ball. 

But there is research, analysis, informed opinion about projects, and some actual news about use cases and adoption stats buried in the crypto press. 

Here’s a general guide to crypto so you will know something about real projects and you can share some of that in informative posts. Hope it helps. 

1) Do some research. 

2) Find projects you believe in.  Are they solving a real market problem? Do they offer something new? Is there some traction with actual users?

3) Asses risk of projects. Are they in the top of their sector? Are they a microcap or thinly traded on an obscure DEX? Do they have a solid team? Have they hit their milestones?

4) Assess your risk tolerance. Will you lose sleep over a 10%, 25%, 80% drop (and don’t risk more than you can afford to lose.)

5) Pick a buy/sell strategy and a time horizon. Are you investing for the long term, trading to hold over days/months. These involve different strategies. None are guaranteed to produce profits. All involve various degrees of risk. 

6) Pick an exit strategy. How much gain or loss is enough? How do you want to spend what you earned? Do you want to move assets to a more secure place if markets turn rough (plenty of stories about not being able to move assets when sone exchanges can’t handle volume-but not all)

7) Consider security of your assets. Have backups of seed phrases. Consider cold storage. Evaluate security of different exchanges. 

If nothing else, have a methodical plan and learn to assess risk (yours and market).

Worries about highly indebted property developer China Evergrande's ability to pay interest on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds has prompted comparisons to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the subsequent financial crisis.

When it comes to the actual scale of impact, analysts point out that Evergrande holds land, while Lehman held financial assets.

Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl winner and quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has said he would be interested in receiving some of his salary in cryptocurrency.   

“I’d love to request that to get paid in some crypto and, you know, to get paid in some Bitcoin or Ethereum or Solana tokens,” Brady said on a SiriusXM podcast earlier this week. 

“I think it’s an amazing thing that’s happening in the world with the way the world is becoming more digital. And these digital currencies, along with a lot of, if you look how the way the world is going, with all these different digital mediums and how they’re impacting currencies,” Brady added.

I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally… I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further.

### Block0 And Tezos

Today, [Block0](http://block0.io/), a leading  blockchain consulting and development company, has announced that it is  strengthening its involvement within the ecosystem and becoming a  corporate baker on Tezos. 

Through their new position as a baker, Block0 will now validate transactions (blocks) and add them to the Tezos blockchain.

Block0 is among the first firms dedicated to blockchain  technology in Wallonia, working within the market since 2017. With  active clients within the energy, agri-food, logistics, and software  development sectors, the firm has been providing decentralized  solutions, in order to apply them to traceability, logistics and  identification of things and people.

Block0 has built several industrial applications that address the need for secure and transparent traceability in supply chains.

Today, Block0 joins forces with the Tezos network, as it is gaining  enormous adoption and interest from customers looking at processing  large amounts of information with the speed, energy-efficiency and low  cost , and the security of an evolutive blockchain.

Tezos is one of the original Proof-of-Stake layer one  blockchain networks. The Tezos ecosystem is built on low-gas fees,  cross-chain utility, yield farming protocols, efficient DEXs, bustling  NFT platforms, and more. With over 3.2 million contract calls in August,  Tezos is one of the fastest growing blockchain ecosystems.

On Tezos, developers are able to easily build powerful decentralized  applications and products. Projects and brands such as Red Bull Racing  Honda, McLaren Racing, OneOf, Ubisoft, Interpop, Hic-Et-Nunc, and more  have chosen to build on the Tezos blockchain.

Upgrades on Tezos are made possible by its proven on-chain  governance where continuous improvements are proposed by participants  on the network, voted on, adopted, and deployed without the need to rely  on hard forks.

This upgrade mechanism minimizes disruptions while offering regular upgradability and enhanced functionality over time.

So far, Tezos has undergone seven network upgrades that have reduced  gas fees by 70%, improved token standards, increased transaction speed,  and more.

Sebastien Pirlet, Block0 representative, added:

This means that the returns they are crediting to smart investing are really just pre-set and paid out of a bitcoin wallet to selected and approved accounts (likely internal). The origins of the $1.3 billion in bitcoin is sketchy and some assume it's from an exit scam.

So basically every time Bitcoin forms a golden cup and handle fibonnaci crossflag trendline, we see the price go at least 10x. Which would put it at a beautiful 400k by the end of the year. **(Not the end of this year, but some other year).** And I saw the same thing happening our much loved coin Ergo.

Dogecoin saw a ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ correction, so that should also go up very soon. And Cardano is clearly forming a reversed ass and tits. But not sure what that will mean for the price. Maybe some sideways action, but if it starts going down, that's bad. That means Cardano will be worth less dollars. If it goes up, that means Cardano will be worth more.

Summary

The upcoming launch of the new Swash ecosystem will enable key stakeholders to work together by providing novel incentivisation mechanisms that cater to the needs of everyone involved. This article is centred on introducing you to the Swash universe, the First Wave Solutions to be built and launched on Swash tech, and the value driver behind it all: the Swash token.

TL;DR:

Swash, the world’s first and most successful Data Union, is expanding into an all-inclusive data ecosystem

System stakeholders - individuals, businesses, and developers - will be incentivised by new tools and monetisation mechanisms to encourage their involvement

The first wave solutions to be built on top of Swash core technology include Data Union, sIntelligence, sApps, and sCompute

The Swash ecosystem will be powered by Swash’s own native currency, the Swash token (SWASH)

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of this article explores each point in more depth, while more materials - including the whitepaper and an archive of media features - can be found on our website.

Swash is a movement for reimagining data ownership.

Swash’s all-inclusive data ecosystem will enable true collaboration while unlocking unique value systems through innovative monetisation mechanisms. The communities contributing to this system are driven by the belief that people should be appreciated for the data they generate and are driven by the desire to be part of a future information economy that works in the interests of everyone without compromising on transparency, privacy, or individual agency.

Realities of a world dominated by data

There is an immense opportunity here for everyone involved, starting with every single internet user. Data is valuable and its worth is only set to increase, with the European Commission currently pegging the data economy at a staggering $3 trillion dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is only the beginning.

With increasing digitisation and the prevalence of embedded devices, every individual creates an estimated 1.7MB of data every second, with the global datasphere expected to grow to 175 zettabytes by 2025. With these figures in mind, it’s crucial that people are recognised for their integral role within this burgeoning economy.

&amp;#x200B;

People are already waking up to this and demanding better standards. An estimated 81 percent of adults feel like they lack control over their data as they become more aware of its influence in their lives. Scandals like Cambridge Analytica-Facebook, increasing regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and the impending demise of third-party cookies are the driving force behind this movement.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re at the point where the impact of data on society is clear, especially when Big Tech companies like Facebook and Google - whose business models revolve around their ability to collect hoards of user information and use it for advertising - are the most valuable companies on the planet. Whether through benign advertising or its application in political campaigns or misinformation around COVID-19 health data, we are in desperate need of alternative solutions that provide robust systems built on transparency and fairness, rather than supporting those that exacerbate existing issues with little motivation to do better.

Reaching breaking point

If we don’t do something about the data dilemma, the world is at risk. In the information age, you are your data.

We’ve reached a point where data defines every aspect of our lives, yet people don’t have any ownership over their personal information. They’re unable to control what happens to it; how it’s collected, used, and sold, and don’t receive any of the value it generates. Without the right technical skills, they can’t regain control or receive their fair share for their contributions, leaving everyday internet users at the mercy of monopolies with no way out.

&amp;#x200B;

If any business wants to survive in this climate, they need insights. But with massive data silos held by monolithic institutions, the data they’re left with is expensive, low-quality, and collected without user knowledge or consent. If they don’t want to make the situation worse, they’re left with few alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

The people who could build those alternatives have their own problems. Those same data silos make accessing large amounts of high-quality data difficult, stifling innovation and leading to issues like discrimination and bias in AI.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, tech entrepreneurs have to build without any clean and easy way to communicate with their users or to reward them for their participation, exacerbating the skewed power dynamic between online platforms and the people they serve. Noone, except stakeholders in big tech companies, benefits from the current status quo.

Time for a new dawn

Fabric Ventures: What Is Web 3.0 &amp; Why It Matters

&amp;#x200B;

As we enter a new decade, a paradigm shift is unfolding in the realm of data. Sparked by the world of Web 3, we’re witnessing a movement towards more collaborative, sustainable, and transparent systems that work in the interest of the majority.

&amp;#x200B;

The alignment of sentiment, legislation, and decentralisation provides a unique opportunity to open up the world of data ownership to the masses, giving people a say in what happens with fair compensation for their efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

This couldn’t be more urgent. Data aside, the world has never seen more extreme income disparity. If profits made from data sales were shared between the people who created it in the first place, what could our world look like?

This is where Swash comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

Swash was born as a solution to these problems, driven by the urgent need to reform the current way we do data. Instead of a system that bleeds agency from individuals, we’re replacing it with one where people can reclaim their data dignity, businesses can thrive, and developers can innovate with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

Expanding from the successes and learnings of the Swash browser application, the enhanced Swash ecosystem will bring individuals, businesses, and developers together through revolutionary incentivisation mechanisms that work to the needs of everyone. Unique tools and innovations will make it possible for all actors to cultivate fresh realities of data ownership and value creation.

&amp;#x200B;

“Swash is a key component of how we mainstream a new data economy, whether we call it an open data economy or something else. We need these cornerstones that allow for the average person to be able to take back control of their data and then to turn that data into a commodity. This has the potential to become a form of Universal Basic Income.”

&amp;#x200B;

\- Jamie Burke, Founder of Outlier Ventures

Inevitable change, unstoppable movement

&amp;#x200B;

With the success of Swash so far and its position as the world’s first Data Union, it was only a matter of time before it would emerge from the shallows and evolve into a universal data ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

This expansion will bring Swash even closer to its vision of redefining how data is collected and valued to balance power dynamics and to make more of what already is, providing an easy way to passively earn and innovate, creating a fairer world and better, more equitable internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Since its inception in 2019, Swash has grown into one of the largest, most robust applications in the blockchain space, growing from 5000 to 50,000 members within mere months. This momentum hasn’t gone unnoticed, with Swash featured as a prime example of a ‘bottom-up’ data institution by the Open Data Institute (ODI) and featured in pioneering research by the Mozilla Foundation that determined the need for “killer apps” if we want to create sustainable Data Futures. The success and adoption of Swash has also launched Data Unions into the mainstream, attracting attention from the likes of MIT, the Financial Times, and the EU Data Governance Act.

&amp;#x200B;

This success has only been possible with the support of the Swash community and our vast constellation of partners and collaborators. Working with some of the best minds in the blockchain space, including Streamr, Ocean Protocol, Chainlink, Outlier Ventures, and Boson Protocol, redefining standards around data privacy as a founding member of the DPPA, and partners with the WEDF, and MyData Online, and getting featured by the likes of Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, and GirlGoneCrypto, has positioned Swash as a leading example of what happens when you combine technology with people power at the forefront of the decentralised data industry.

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear to us how important it was to continue expanding Swash into a fully collaborative and efficient value chain as we enter the next stage of the information epoch. We want to provide practical solutions for Swash stakeholders by working towards a truly symbiotic system that’s driven by the ethos of Web 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we are pleased to introduce you to the next evolution of Swash; an overview of the ecosystem and the principles behind it, the first generation of solutions built on Swash core technology, and the driving force behind it all: the Swash token.

A peek at the Swash ecosystem

Envisioning the future: Key principles

&amp;#x200B;

To make this work, Swash must be able to reach all corners of the information economy. This is complicated and uncharted territory, so we’re distilling the driving force behind the movement into four key principles to address the immediate concerns of each stakeholder and to offer the right incentives for them to get involved in a sustainable, scalable way.

&amp;#x200B;

The following four principles will be used to underpin all design, development, and innovation within Swash, keeping everyone engaged and the Swash community active:

&amp;#x200B;

Incentivise: Provide a way for users to get paid for the value of their data and to encourage more people to join the community

Access: Improve access to high-quality, zero-party data for businesses and data scientists

Build: Encourage developers and entrepreneurs to join a new generation of data solutions

Collaborate: Work alongside ecosystem partners to allow for interoperability and mass adoption at scale towards a wider vision for the future of data

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, these principles help to make sure that everyone; including individuals, developers, businesses, partners, community, and innovators, are motivated by the same vision and stay aligned as Swash grows.

Take-off: Launching Swash First Wave Solutions

&amp;#x200B;

With the launch of the Swash ecosystem comes the birth of the First Wave Solutions. These solutions - united by Swash key principles - will seek to ignite curiosity and spark innovation among the community.

&amp;#x200B;

The first breed of solutions, outlined below, are just the tip of the iceberg. As Swash grows and relationships expand, the solutions and apps built onto Swash technology will give rise to a powerful community of collaborators.

&amp;#x200B;

Each solution is explored in-depth in the whitepaper, which will be released soon. Until then, here’s a taster:

Data Union: Optimising individual agency as a collective force by rewarding union members for the value of their data

&amp;#x200B;

The Data Union works to manage and protect the interests of its members. As a result, those members have greater power and control over how their data is collected, accessed, and used while receiving a portion of the profits generated.

&amp;#x200B;

By rewarding people for the value of their data, people can earn for activities they already do online - like surfing the web - enabling individuals to practice their data rights while celebrating their role as essential value providers in a thriving network.

sIntelligence: Bringing unique insights to businesses across all industries through a customisable, comprehensive web-based platform

&amp;#x200B;

Businesses need insights about their industry, market, and rivals to stay informed and get ahead of their competition. However, the current Competitive and Market Intelligence (CMI) landscape is broken - it’s dominated by a few key players who are increasingly susceptible to regulatory pressure, sentiment around data rights, and the need for sustainable data collection and usage.

&amp;#x200B;

sIntelligence provides unique, unrivalled business intelligence in an easy-to-use, customisable platform, providing businesses with everything they need to get a competitive advantage in their sector. It will use aggregated Swash data to show companies their key metrics via a web-based platform.

sApps: Expanding the Swash ecosystem with the tools, community, and culture for building the next era of data solutions

&amp;#x200B;

If Web 2 has taught us anything, it’s that the biggest companies in the coming decade will be those that know what to do with data. Developers who want to be a part of the next generation of data solutions can hit the ground running by tapping into the Swash network and building their own applications on Swash technology (sApps).

&amp;#x200B;

sApps will have many uses and can come in a variety of forms but are aligned by the ability to redistribute rewards and other compensation back to users of sApps. sApps will also make it possible to communicate directly with users to get to know them better and provide another value stream, such as by viewing ads or answering questions or polls.

sCompute: Uniting innovation with access by making on-site data computation capabilities a reality

&amp;#x200B;

Data Scientists struggle to innovate due to a lack of access to data. If large amounts of diverse, reliable data is available, then Artificial Intelligence models will become more accurate and less biased. In practice, it’s difficult to find and access large amounts of data due to the risks associated with sharing and storing it.

&amp;#x200B;

With sCompute, Swash makes it possible for data scientists to perform computations on data without needing to purchase it. The data itself remains private and isn’t sold or moved. Instead, they can deploy their algorithms on Swash data and pay only for the computation and to access the results. The results and products built from this computation can also be resold to generate value for both data scientists and the data contributors whose data was included in the dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

“We can’t wait to take this to the next level and bring even more value to more people. Swash is unique in that it operates on a better-than-free model, which is why we’ve decided to run with incentivisation mechanisms and the idea of bringing an abundance of value. We want to take what we’ve learned so far and catapult it into a whole new dimension. What we’re doing is changing the way we look at data.”

&amp;#x200B;

\- Reza Naeeni, Swash

The Swash token - Powering a world of data

&amp;#x200B;

The Swash value chain will be powered by its native token (SWASH). SWASH will have a variety of use cases within the ecosystem and will be used as a cross-chain utility and governance token integrating xDai, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. It will also be fused with our constellation of partners and their native currencies, allowing for cross-fertilisation of value, increased adoption, and a seamless user experience.

&amp;#x200B;

As demand for SWASH will increase alongside network adoption, generated value may be used to balance the token supply, likely through periodical token 'burning'.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the Swash expansion is live, use cases for the Swash token will include:

&amp;#x200B;

Incentivise: As an incentive system, ecosystem actors will be rewarded with Swash tokens in return for their participation.

Transact: All data transactions across all marketplaces, platforms, and applications will be distributed in SWASH. This includes value generated within the business intelligence and analytics platform (sIntelligence), the data computation environment (sCompute), and solutions developed utilising Swash technology (sApps).

Govern: Swash token holders can vote for projects they wish to see receive funding from the Swash DAO fund, decide on new roadmap developments or modifications, and to take part in token-related decisions.

Multiply: People can individually and collectively contribute the value of their data to social development causes and use it for value exchange both within and outside the Swash universe, such as redeeming earnings for products or staking liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

The current data economy has struggled with monopolised structures, lack of transparency, and stifled innovation for decades, but it doesn’t have to be like this. Swash has already proven that other structures are not only possible; they’re already happening through its success as the world’s first and largest digital Data Union.

&amp;#x200B;

Swash is a movement for unlocking new ways of doing data. As a known leader in the realm of decentralised data and the bridge towards mainstream adoption, Swash is now carving out a reality that recognises the value of every actor while incubating and giving rise to the next genesis of information-adjacent solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

Swash enables internet users, developers, and businesses to cultivate alternative systems of data ownership and value creation.

&amp;#x200B;

For internet users:

&amp;#x200B;

Regain ownership and receive passive income as they surf the web

Collectively invest value of data into social development

Exchange data value for alternative ecosystem benefits

&amp;#x200B;

For businesses:

&amp;#x200B;

Access high-quality, zero-party data at scale

Save time and money by eliminating intermediaries and reducing ad fraud and bots

Improve the reputation and sustainability of business practices

&amp;#x200B;

For developers:

&amp;#x200B;

Accelerate innovation due to improved access to diverse data

Be part of a new generation of data solutions

User acquisition through incentivisation mechanics and communication

&amp;#x200B;

Over the coming months, we will be sharing everything you need to know about Swash’s new adventure in preparation for the Swash token launch.

A typical one is to track an index and if necessary with occasional rebalancing.

Since I could not find such an analysis in the cryptocurrency area, I wrote a simple Python script to perform such an analysis.  
I have compared the performance of Bitcoin with the investment on the Top10 index.  
On the one hand ""non-weighted"", so in each of the Top10 coins the same amount invest.  
On the other hand ""weighted"", i.e. investing different amounts in the top10 according to market capitalization.  
Since some countries prescribe holding periods of one year to be tax-free, the period of analysis is chosen so that the Top10 coins are were for 1 year and then invested again in the then current Top10. Trading fees are neglected in this analysis.

The first plot shows how many dollars you would have now (01-09-2021) if you had invested $1 in January 2016. The second plot (on Github) shows the gains in percent per year.

The results are not an investment recommendation.

We  could probably find a better abbreviation for that but does not matter  for now. There are many people spreading FUD without any facts to back  it up. But there are also many people spreading HCF without any facts to  back it up. Both can lead to bad investment decisions.

This needs 500 words to not be deleted, so as per popular request, here is the lyrics to ""Dancing Queen"":

Ooh, you can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene  
Digging the dancing queen  
 

Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come to look for a king  
 

Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
 

You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
Oh, yeah  
 

You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene  
Digging the dancing queen  
 

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
 

You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
Oh, yeah  
 

You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene  
Digging the dancing queen

I’ll briefly dive into the events in correlation to the technicals of crypto at this time.

First I would like to point out that a black swan event is something you don’t see, like a virus or war, such event was the corona-dump which resulted by not just one country’s economy. Something as big as Evergrande was likely foreseen by chinese economists, with China now pumping money in Evergrande to avoid such market crash. They've also been granted a bond payment deal. In addition China relies a lot on USD for global business and crashing it wouldn’t be in their favor. My opinion is that this had a small FUD effect, that’s it.

The crypto market is doing what it’s supposed to be doing. Analysis:

On the 21st of July, the 5th wave began forming to what followed 7 weeks of just upside and a lot of greed. BTC needed to back-test support levels in order to continue a healthy uptrend. It went lower than expected for some, but still major support. In it’s own, a smaller elliot wave formed on the daily chart and it’s now doing the final (C) corrective wave. (This alone indicated a further downside before the evergrande event). 

It just happened to fall below a head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart which put BTC in a technical target of 35k, BUT it bounced off the 111 day MA around 40k. When it gets above it and tests it as support, it consolidates and continues. To me 40k the support, if it loses that it could potentially dip to 35k before continuation.

All in all, I’m seeing a healthy crypto market, mimicing almost the previous wave but in larger timeframes. Whereas this correction took days in the previous wave, it’s now taking weeks but if we’re looking at 150k btc this is fair. Of course FUD contributed a bit to these corrections. 35k btc should not fear you, it’s bullish until it’s not.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3491719,public,self,"Evergrande is not a black swan event, here’s why",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pt431m/evergrande_is_not_a_black_swan_event_heres_why/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

###Trust of open-source protocols tasked with distribution and validation

A centralised authority such as a government are the only ones who are trusted to distribute and validate a currency - though whenever there is such concentration of power, there is inevitably, corruption, greed, and nepotism. 

Cryptocurrencies are not politically or geographically centralised, meaning they are not vulnerable to flaws like a centralised system. However they are logically centralised, meaning there is one commonly agreed state and the network (if working as intended) behaves like a single trustworthy system. 

###Security of decentralised systems is baked into the protocols

Security by governing authorities are costly, time consuming and mostly present centralised points of weaknesses. 

Cryptocurrencies’ use of encryption algorithms and automatic consensus mechanisms, make it virtually impossible for third-parties to retrieve, corrupt or disrupt data - the ‘crypto’ in cryptocurrency. Security is baked in without the need for third-parties to approve, corroborate or validate transactions. 

###Scalability of global payment processing systems is complex to say the least

Scalability of millions of individual transactions across thousands of geographical locations, whilst still being trusted and secure, has proven to be the most difficult issue to solve.

Electronic payment systems, such as Visa claim 1,700 transactions per second (no they can not process 24,000 tps - this has never been the claim or the reality), can be fulfilled through their network, a figure it rarely exceeds, with which any decentralised network is going to have to compete. 

Blockchain scaling can be implemented in a range of ways, from Layer-1 solutions like increasing the block size and sharding (more on these later), to Layer-2 solutions such as the Lightning Network, all of which carry various trade-offs. Blockchains may become ”faster” but that also often means they become more “centralised” - because, for example, they have to rely on a much lower number of validators. 

###Speed and decentralization essentially exist on a spectrum, so the more you have of one, the less you have of the other. There is nothing inherently wrong with having a fast but semi-centralized blockchain, but it compromises the permission less and censorship-resistant properties that make the blockchain so unique. 

###“Cryptoeconomics didn’t begin and end with Satoshi’s whitepaper — it’s a body of techniques that we are only learning to apply. Not just in the design of core protocols, but in the design of second layer systems that extend the functionality of the underlying blockchain.” Josh Stark

###Proof-of-Work

Proof-of-Work (PoW) uses computational power and electricity to validate and secure transactions. This is an external validation process - meaning an external resource is used to ‘create’ blocks on a blockchain (validate, approve and secure transactions). It is highly secure and benefits from being totally decentralised (no external governance needed) but has issues of scalability. 

**Bitcoin BTC** uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism which is highly secure and trusted but proving difficult to scale, as the blockchain grows the amount of computer processing power needed also increases, which can be slow and hence not scalable. With only 7 transactions per second taking 10 minutes to confirm, it requires Layer-2 solutions like the ‘Lightening Network’ to function effectively as a global currency. Transactions can be fulfilled in seconds but it is a centralised solution - the payments are processed and collated through the Lightening central processing network before they are ratified by the blockchain as the settlement layer. (Again this is not necessarily bad, but centralisation creates issues of security and privacy).

As Bitcoin faced the problem that it was taking too long to process transactions. A portion of the Bitcoin network, notably bitcoin miners, favored a solution of increasing the block size above the standard 1 megabyte. The developers in the Bitcoin network, however, did not like this solution as it made the network more susceptible to hacking. Their preferred solution was to separate the blockchain functionality from the actual transaction processing in a scheme called Segregated Witness (SegWit for short). Because not all members of the Bitcoin network agreed to adopt the software changes implementing SegWit, it was possible for the network to fracture into distinct and separate networks. This fracture occurred on August 1, 2017, with the Bitcoin network splitting into two cryptocurrencies.

**Bitcoin Cash BCH** is a ‘hard fork’ of the original Bitcoin, and claims to have addressed the scalability issue by increasing the maximum block size, from 1MB up to 32MB, with ongoing research to allow future increases. This Layer-1 solution addresses the issue of scalability, allowing 116 tps, meaning more transactions are able to be processed - “Transact in seconds. Get confirmed in minutes.” However, it can still not compete with Visa’s 1700 tps and although big blocks are faster, they sacrifice decentralization because more powerful computers are needed to process larger blocks. (Small blocks are slower, but maintain the key advantages of decentralization and security because more nodes can join and maintain the network).

**Ethereum ETH** currently uses a PoW consensus mechanism which only manages 15 tps and requires every transaction to be processed by every single node in the network, so hence has scalability issues. For the network to handle millions of transactions, which it now does because of smart contracts running decentralised finance projects and NFT exchanges, the network is often slow and intolerably expensive (‘gas fees’ are charged to validate transactions, the rewards paid to the miners - the busier the network the higher the fees). 

###Proof-of-Stake

Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism that validates transactions that is reflective of their ownership stake. For instance, a miner who owns 3% of the coins available can theoretically mine only 3% of the blocks. Validators are chosen at random to create blocks and are responsible for checking and confirming blocks they don't create. This is a purely internal validation process, meaning it does not require external resources to confirm blocks. This is a point of contention because there is less separation between power (control) and money - whoever has the most coins is the most powerful, which can hardly be said to be decentralised. 

This does mean though there should be lower barriers to entry because of the reduced hardware requirements, which should lead to more nodes in the network - improving participation and hence decentralisation and transaction speeds. (It also allows for stronger support for Sharding). Criticisms have been made that the opposite may be true and PoS increases the risk of an oligarchy forming (largest stake pools have the most power) introducing concepts of a formal governance structure. Again, conflicts of centralisation and security arise. 

###Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions

One **Layer-1 solution** (one that is built into the blockchain), is known as **sharding** and is where the network is divided into two sections which could operate semi-independently and double the transaction speeds, since transactions can be processed by two nodes at the same time. 

Another **Layer-2 solution** (one that is built on top of the blockchain), would be for the transactions to happen ‘off-chain’ while still guaranteeing a sufficient level of security and finality by referring back to the blockchain, when a large enough number of transactions have been completed. In other words, instead of making thousands of small transactions many times, one larger transaction is made less frequently. This is called a ‘State channel’ solution and is how the Lightening Network works on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

##It should be no surprise then that Bitcoin and Ethereum are at the forefront of creating and implementing a combination of all these mechanisms with the Bitcoin ‘Taproot’ and Ethereum 2.0 upgrades. 

Other projects, such as Cardano ADA, Algorand ALGO, Solana SOL, Polkadot DOT, use Proof-of-Stake or Delegated Proof-of-Stake protocols and Sharding mechanisms - combining core design with smart contract functionalities to work as payment systems. 

Stellar Lumens XLM, Ripple XRP are PoW blockchains but use Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) protocols - essentially meaning much smaller computers can be used to validate transactions. Hashgraph HBAR, uses hashing mechanisms but is essentially a closed network. They have all made projects claiming to have solved the issues of trust, security and scale - designed from the ground up to work as currencies. 

Whether it’s Layer-1 solutions, built “into” the blockchain, or Layer-2 solutions, built “on top of” the blockchain, Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake or Byzantine Agreements, or any mixture of them all, they have proven to be more than capable of competing or in some cases outperforming centralised payment systems and hence worthy as currencies. 

Which one will be the most successful in the long run is still unanswered. Whether different solutions will be used for differing use cases is also very likely. 

###But what can’t be questioned. This mixture of direct financial skin in the game of all parties involved - investors, users, developers - and innovating technology, can’t be found anywhere else and makes the community so fascinating. 

As usual, this is not a comprehensive post, it is attempting to explain complex issues in simplified terms. Any issues or errors with accuracy would be considered and greatly appreciated.

How did I come to this conclusion? Well its simple, I used a technique called moonboi analysis, it consists of complicated geometry to measure things like how wide their mouths and eyes are open. And a little Palaeography to decipher things like rocket and moon emojis as well as arrows pointing in different directions. 

In the following chart you can see obvious proof of what I'm trying to explain.

I love Ethereum and I genuinely like the people that have anything meaningful to say about ethereum whether it's technical or memes, etc.

However, almost every ""big"" ethereum twitter page I've seen is more cult-ish that even SHIB, Doge or Safemoon communities. Everything to them is fud (even valid criticism), attacking other projects at any chance while blowing things out of proportion. Think of people like ""eth jesus"", ""0xsossal"" (or whatever his name is), etc.

I think this culty behaviour is ignorant &amp; we see people here get ridiculed because they believe in shitcoins like shib, doge, etc. but no one really says the same about these cult ethereum pages or even speaks out about them.

This week the product goes into restricted release in the UK. Lancelot will deploy Adwatch to analyse and secure all client digital campaigns, from origin to destination. Lancelot Media London will work with a carefully selected number of UK based media agencies dedicated to the elimination of ad fraud, before AdWatch UK goes to general release early next year.

In recent years there has been an exponential growth of Blockchain technology but much less so in the advertising sector, which have only gradually adopted these advanced technologies.

On the other hand, the exponential growth in investment in digital advertising requires increasingly demanding monitoring of an environment so susceptible to fraud.

There is a global clamour that demands transparency and trust, vectors that increasingly demand more from companies and from which the advertising sector is not now exempt.

AdWatch's blockchain offering is characterised by traceability and immutability. The first is achieved by facilitating encryption at the origin of any advert. The tags from this process are then monitored through to the destination and verified as intact before launching an impression, allowing total control and traceability from source.

Once that imprint is launched, the data collected is encrypted and stored securely in the Blockchain, providing the aforementioned immutability.

**Richard Parboo, CEO of Lancelot Media London:** “Our clients’ sentiments around ad fraud range from concern to exasperation. So, this alliance with AdWatch to incorporate blockchain technologies and AI to their campaigns makes sense. The timing is most opportune too, as our clients, like most businesses, have been hard hit by the pandemic and urgently need to see increases in ROI against their ad spend. Leveraging Blockchain technology to reduce losses due to ad fraud will have a positive impact on advertisers &amp; brands, additionally media agency buying teams.”

**According to Jose Luis Casado, CEO of AdWatch:** ""This technology is here to stay. In Europe we have effectively demonstrated that this innovative mix of blockchain and AI approaches throughout the full ad journey provides the traceability demanded by digital advertising globally.”

It typically happens when a victim unknowingly installs cryptocurrency miner malware through a phishing link, malicious website, or software download, enabling the criminals to access the victim's device.**

According to the data presented by the Atlas VPN team, cryptocurrency miners were the most common malware family, with 74,490 such threats detected in the first half of 2021. 

Crypto-mining malware is not easily discoverable on victims' devices, making it a continuously profit-generating cyberattack. The anonymity of cryptocurrencies is very convenient for threat actors, as they can benefit from their victims without being caught. 

The data is based on [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html) *Attacks from All Angles: 2021 Midyear Cybersecurity Report*. The research examines dangerous vulnerabilities across different devices and operating systems, including the threats targeting these flaws.

**In addition to cryptocurrency miners,** **WannaCry** **ransomware threats were seen 61,068 times in the first half of 2021. WannaCry is a ransomware cryptoworm, which targets devices running the Windows operating system and spreads across networks. It was responsible for a worldwide cyberattack in 2017, which affected about 200,000 computers across 150 countries.**

What is more, malware detection infrastructure identified 39,612 webshell threats in H1 2021. A webshell attack happens when a malicious user successfully exploits web servers and enables remote access to the affected machines. An attacker could essentially do anything on the victim's computer once they have access.

Security infrastructure also detected 39,095 Downad adware threats and 35,276 Nemucod trojan threats. Other commonly found malware families in H1 2021 include Dloader (32,397), Sality (28,310), Equated (24,564), Powload (22,921), and Virux (22,865). 

## Most active types of crypto miners

Cybercriminals seek to infect as many computers as possible to increase their profits. Different types of crypto miners help hackers turn computers into robots with one task only — generating more cryptocurrency.

The most active cryptocurrency miner in the first half of 2021 was MalXMR, with 44,587 detections. MalXMR is a crypto-mining malware that exploited EternalBlue for propagation and abused Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). During the infection, high CPU utilization can be noticed with powershell.exe or schtasks.exe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinminer** **came up second with a total of 8,533 detections in H1 2021. Coinminer can usually be found on Android phones in fake versions of popular apps from third-party sources. Some crypto miners were even found on Google Play Store apps. The infected device may overheat, charge slowly or show other signs of heavy resource processing.**

Next up, ToolXMR crypto miner was identified 6,419 times in the first half of 2021. ToolXMR mines Monero cryptocurrency and is usually dropped by other malware from remote sites. Like MalXMR, it uses the system's CPU and GPU resources to mine cryptocurrency, making the computer run painfully slow.

Lastly, CoinMine and MalBTC round out the top 5 most detected cryptocurrency miners list with 4,082 and 2,328 identifications, respectively.

Cryptocurrency mining malware has allowed cybercriminals to earn profit with more efficiency and less effort.

Le fondateur et cofondateur, qui ont a eux deux finis premier et second du ""Les Talents du Trading"" de BFM BUISNESS, d'où des pub télévisée devrait apparaitre d'ici fin d'année, début 2022,

Le directeur financier nous vient tout droit de chez sanofi Canada.

Il prévois 3 millions de client a 2023, (Un client compte environ 1000 euros par capitalisation ce qui représente très vite une capitalisation de prêt de 4 milliards à fin de 2022),pour une capitalisation en introduction de 10 à 40 millions, (comparaison avec REVOLUT)

Partenariat signé avec Thales

WealthHub\* algorithmique qui est connecté aux échanges centralisés (crypto et marchés traditionnels). Le richHub pour sa version test est connecté à Binance (ils sont entrain de branché Bittrex), a terme tous les exchanges full régulé en Europe seront connectés (Coinbase, kraken, etc…. Pour les broker traditional market AKT travail avec le broker de FTX exchange pour le moment qui sera actif une fois les outils d'investissement share lancé sur l'app V2)

\*(Bien comprendre le WealthHUB : c'est un algorithme multi node et multi routes - cela permet d'accéder à la meilleure liquidité disponible et le meilleur prix pour éviter l'exécution de trade hors de prix et garantir la meilleure exec (prix/ temps)  
Exemple :

Pour vendre de l'EUR et Acheter du DOGE pour 10000 EUR - exemple avec le richHub :

1/ exécution de 2000 EUR en BUSD puis BUSD en DOGE en utilisant Binance  
2/ exécution de 7000 EUR en USDT puis USDT en DOGE en utilisant KRAKEN  
3/ exécution de 1000 EUR en ETH puis ETH en DOGE en utilisant BITTREX)

Cela permet toujours d'avoir de la liquidité et surtout de garantir le meilleur prix par rapport à la liquidité disponible sur le marché =&gt; surtout pour les ordres qui dépassent les 100K

AKT est une banque et ne remplace pas pas Binance ou un DEX, il cherche un amener de la liquidité à la défi et aux échanges crypto mais pas que, L'Europe détient la plus grande quantité d'épargne au monde et des taux proches de 0 ou négatif donc aucun rendement.

Compte courant, épargne défi, robot et accès aux marchés d'échanges sous une même application le tout connecté à une carte de paiement. L'argent n'est jamais bloqué et reste dispo instantanément.

(Aujourd'hui aucune plateforme ne propose une solution complète)

Attention, leurs cibles ne sont pas des noob, ce sont des personnes qui cherchent à être accompagnées sans barrière technique trop compliquée à d'autres outils d'investissement tout en gardant un contrôle total sur leurs argents pour les besoins quotidiens - en connectant la carte au richesse hub cela signifie qu'un paiement peut être fait depuis le coffre-fort compte qui est connecté à AAVE (a terme d'autre solution aussi) et permet donc de générer des intérêts quotidiens et de payer avec…

Nous sommes encore au début d'un massif de phénomène donc il y a encore beaucoup d'opportunité à saisir.

C'est clairement la banque qui peut devenir les amis des personnes végétant dans le milieu de la crypto et des types qui craquent sur le livret A. Végétant tous simplement à l'abaque postale, crédit mutuel, SG, CA ou autre….

Pour les fans de Hedera, ils ont un partenariat en cours. Ils font le codage de leur jeton. Hedera qui parle d'un investissement de plusieurs millions d'euros (20M) et ne prend ni actions ni tokens, c'est un simple investissement dans le but de developper et vendre leur blockchain

l'idée est surtout de développer des outils décentralisés avec Hedera, pas d'augmenter le volume de transactions spéculatives qui n'est finalement qu'une niche, ils veulent ajouter de la valeur dans les transactions et augmenter le volume (ex : décentralisé le KYC, le paiement, le track record des opérations et leur traitement comptable, l'emprunte carbone digitale par utilisateur, etc…) le DLT de Hedera est le plus régulé au monde, (une fois que les régulateurs vont secouer le cocotier on verra ceux qui restent en place)  
Un régulateur peut imposer un arrêt net des opérations des acteurs décentralisés et donc tué son business du jour au lendemain… ce sera pas le cas avec un partenaire comme Hedera

Token côté chez Bittrex probablement le 26 octobre - un échange Bittrex puis step by step. Les bourses n'ont presque pas de liquidités et les teneurs de marché sont obligés d'adapter leurs stratégies en fonction du volume journalier et de l'attrait sur le jeton ou la crypto. Il faut donc d'abord pouvoir absorber les échanges sur un échange et attendre que l'élan augmente avant de se projeter sur d'autres échanges. Nous réussirons les meilleur prix 'exec avec Bittrex donc l'utilisateur en vendant son Coin sur Akt sera bien exécuté au bon prix en fonction du choix de son abonnement (free, premium)

This is why DOGE was nothing else than FOMO and viral investing. This is why DOGE will fall from the Top10. Will it come back? Sure, after crashing to 1 cent, the viral cycle can start again. And it will be temporal again.

15474 transactions. The lowest in almost 4 years, in the middle of a bull run. We had 20-30k transactions in 2018-2020, during the crypto winter.

How many transactions other chain process?

* Cardano 80k
* Bitcoin Cash 100k
* Litcoin 150k
* Avalancha 170k
* Bitcoin 250k
* Tezos 300k
* Ethereum 1.2M
* Algorand 1.3M
* Fantom 1.5M
* Polygon MATIC 5.5M
* Binance Smart Chain 9M
* Solana 15M (not counting votes)

Most of these chains are doing transactions not far away from their ATH. DOGE ATH happened in 2013. 8 years ago!! after that, it had 8 Pumps and 7 dumps. The 8th dump is happening right now. The code is a fork of a fork of Litecoin done in 2013, and it hasnt improved sifnicantly since then. It doesnt have the throughput to be a global payment system. Elon just loves the attention and the marketing points. After being in the media so long time, adoption decreased. Investors multiplied by 10, by almost none of you are actually using it, just investing for the profits. 

Invest as you will, just be aware, that those funds could be lost. Don't invest more you can afford to lose. 

PS: Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility. Hundreds of thousands of people will be burnt in this FOMO, and will distrust crypto in the future.

I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a different between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally… I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!

Even if I somehow managed to get the verification process finished, the app is slow and stuttery. It does have a great UI, but the performance is meh.

Everything is split into its own seperate app with its own set of bugs, for example the Kraken Pro app lags a lot more than Kraken app, and the Kraken Futures app is absolute garbage with limited number of pairs.

Sorry if this has been asked and answered here before, but I’m curious on what should be the very first thing to read and investigate.
I know a few programming languages, but I think that in order to start reading, language shouldn’t matter much, right?
I want to start with the basics, concepts and mechanics of a blockchain, and move up while learning.

Yes, Evergrande issued a statement that they will pay the on shore debt.

Since the real estate market is 30% of Chinese GDP, this is... comforting well, for now).

One single small block is $100B. $100 Billion. BTC, even with the huge pump it had in 2021, is 18 blocks. Wanna know what the huge clump of blocks is? That's the derivates market, which heavily relies on things as futures and securitization of debt (such as debt issued by Evergrande).

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a different between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead.

I’m not going to talk about how good or bad this is about the society or other ethical matters. This publication focuses on investments and this is definitely **THE** theme you should be looking at now that it’s still early. 

 Crypto plays

As we have pointed out before in previous articles [**Sandbox**](https://loftfinancial.com/the-kids-in-the-block-sandbox-like-roblox/) is a similar concept with Roblox. There is a VR world but built on the blockchain where you can own land and using their currency (SAND) you can build games that other people play when they visit your land. The promise is good if they execute correctly and given the recent super hype of AXS (crazy!) the market cap of SAND can go much much higher.

Similarly we have talked about one of our favorite games. This comes in a combo of stock or crypto play. It’s **ATARI** and apart from building a casino on the blockchain they also have other stuff going on with NFTs, gaming and other projects. Don’t forget that this company was kind of dead before crypto mania so nobody knows. On the other hand the **ATRI** coin is pumping predictably for the last 2 years.

And ladies and gentlemen our all time favorite. [**DECENTRALAND**](https://decentraland.org/) and it’s corresponding currency (**MANA**) is the most serious project out there. It’s really a modern **Second Life** (do you remember that game?) but built on the blockchain. They don’t have the VR features that they announced during their ICO in 2017 yet but it’s a fully functional world. Parties are happening, meetups and sales of **NFTs**. Go check it out it’s free and you need only a PC and a browser!

**Somnium Spaces (CUBE)** is a project that is similar to Decentraland but it’s completely in VR mode (but also browser mode) already! Less known gem and with NFT galleries and stuff going on. You can also check out this immediately.

## How to play the theme

The best and safest way to play this is to buy everything and spread your bets depending on your risk tolerance. Buying ATRI and MANA is not the same as buying FB stock quite obviously. On the other hand you know what comes with risk? **REWARD** 🙂 Don’t forget to also buy LAND and coins in the projects you like because we don’t know yet what will be the best play long term.

Yes we exist. We are not all fucking falling over ourselves.

I have a low risk tolerance for most investments in my life. I invest the majority of my money in boring old index funds. They have a moderate risk level and moderate return.

Risk is defined in financial terms as the chance that an outcome or investment's actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or return. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of an original investment.

Crypto is a high risk investment. You could lose 100% of your money (or WAY more...looking at you crazy options traders) and you can earn a nearly unlimited return.

It can be easy to think everyone either thinks crypto is going to 100X or 0.

But far away from the top 10, altcoins have also proven to be gold mines in the past month that almost no one has on their radar.

 **1st place: eCash (XEC)** 

The first place is secured by eCash (XEC). On August 16, one XEC still cost 0.000056 US dollars. 30 days later, one eCash coin costs 0.000253 US dollars on the crypto exchange. This means that eCash's share price has risen by 450 percent.

One possible reason for eCash's rally could be the rebranding announced on July 1, 2021. Because the project was not always called eCash. Before that, it was still called ""Bitcoin Cash ABC"".

 **2nd place: Fantom (FTM)** 

The second place goes to Fantom (FTM). On August 16, the price of a Fantom coin was still quoted at 0.41 US dollars. One month later, on September 15, one had to pay 1.41 US dollars for an FTM. A growth of 343 percent.

At the moment, both NFT and DeFi applications are arguably the most hyped investment themes in the crypto sector. Fantom should benefit most from the fact that the project has a foot in both industries. That's because Fantom has a presence in both the DeFi and NFT sectors.

 3rd place: Avalanche (AVAX) 

Avalanche (AVAX) secured third place. On August 16, one AVAX could be purchased for 20.8 US dollars. One month later, the price of AVAX is already 52.76 US dollars. This is not as big an increase in price as the first place, but with AVAX, crypto investors were able to increase their money by 253 percent.

AVAx is the first smart contract platform to process more than 4,500 transactions per second and instantly confirm transactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you own any of those gems? Havent heard anything about the but AVAX. What was your best performing Coin? My best one was ATOM, right after i bought in it tripled in value in less than 2 months.

&gt;Systems that consider themselves ideological heirs to the cypherpunk spirit should \[...\] be much more expensive to destroy or disrupt than they are to use and maintain.

It is unlikely that crypto will kill banks, destroy governments and collapse the system. But cryptography in general and digital currency in particular gives people \_opportunity\_ to experience privacy, transparency, control of their finances. Which is \_not\_ achieved with tyranny of the majority, force or violence, but with \_mathematics\_. And this, in my opinion, is a beautiful thing.

I'm software engineer and cypherpunk, and I find it amazing that ideas of Zero-knowledge data validation, digital currencies, smart contracts were described some 30 years ago.

***Tim May, 1992***

*A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.*

*Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.*

*The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.*

*The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.*

*Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.*

*Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!*

The resources on general cryptography are vast. I hope I woke up some interest in you to go and educate yourself a bit on it's history and modern applications. Even reading a fiction like Cryptonomicon will help you appreciate what you are hodling )

Regulators Reach:  Celsius is joining the fight in facing regulators in the same vein that BlockFi has.  On Friday, Texas officials filed a cease and desist order against Celsius. The filing will require Celsius to show the state why it shouldn’t be ordered to stop offering it’s products to state residents. Celsius, like BlockFi, faces accusations that it is offering residents unregistered securities. 

The Texas hearing is scheduled for February 24. Both Alabama and New Jersey issued similar actions on the same day. New Jersey ordered the platform to stop offering select products by November 1. Alabama demanded that the platform show why it shouldn’t be halted from offering products within 28 days.

As i understand when i stake the coins will be locked for a while when and thats not the problem since im probably going to hold them for atleast few years. Now the thing is i dont quite understand if i will be able to “add up” more to the same stack and pool i staked. For example i put in 1 eth and lock it. After couple months i decide to buy 0.5 eth and want to stake it aswell. Can i make my stake 1.5 eth or will it be 1 eth locked and  a 0.5 eth locked seperately. Im sorry im new to this i just want to know if i should stake them in bulk or add smaller portions over time. Im not going to sell or trade them so im not really worried about not being able to use it. Is this even worth it or should i just stake/ buy something else? Thanks in advance guys!

I was just talking on another topic with someone and they said ""selling creates a taxable event"".  


What? I suppose he means in USA, not sure how it works for around the world and other countries but IF and WHERE this is the case - crypto has failed.   


The whole premise of crypto was that it will be non government and banks regulated - peoples currency.   


The more we advence yes, the gains can be nice, but I don't think anyone notices how strayed from the original concept it has become.   


Banks are adopting crypto and people are actually cheering it on :S like dafuq? Just because banks accept crypto and its ""easier"" for you to bridge the two - thats exactly the problem.   


Also taxing crypto sells? What so you basically cannot be a day trader in USA? I make like 50 buys/sells a day, if I was taxed for each one of them I would be fucking broke lol. Also why the fuck would I give the government a tax on me selling a speculative digital currency?   


Fuck that. In my eyes crypto has failed considering the current state of things and ""major adoption by institutional players"". Thats exactly what it was supposed to be against, the existing financial paradigm - and now it will just get incorporated by government and banks - and they will make regulations that fit them and not us, the crypto market consumers.   


This shit makes me really sad as I see there is no way in crypto ever lives up anymore to what it was supposed to be, everyone is too busy with their holding and precious gains to even realize they bought us out with this bullshit.   


At this point its just a matter of time before they cause a crash, blame it on crypto volatility and then introduce their CBDC's as an equivalent replacement - because they will totally control it.   


Seriously, taxing fucking crypto sells? What the fuck?????  


I mean I live in a shithole where tax service is so bad they wouldn't ever be able to enforce that but to know its already happening around the world just makes me sad because it means thats the standard things will be made upon now.   


We are truly fucked if we let the government grandpas and bank scumbags carve the regulations for crypto market as all of us will be losers in the end and crypto will just be another useless asset as the government will be able to fuck you over it because they made the rules - again.

I took a look at the last 3 months and compared the lowest price from before the highest price, and then compared the highest price to the lowest for the current drop.

That means late June to date, where most coins had their low around the 18th-20th of July, their highest value around 7th-8th of September and the lowest value in the current drop around... well, yesterday, 21st of September.

And the numbers look like this for a selected few of the top 100:

**BTC:** 

• 29,600-52,600 = 77.7% increase  
• 52,600-40,700 = 22.6% drop  


**ETH:** 

• 1,760-3,960 = 125% increase  
• 3,960-2,770 = 30.05% drop

  
**ADA:**

• 1.05-3.09 = 194.3% increase  
• 3.09-2.00 = 35.3% drop

  
**XRP:**

• 0.53-1.41 = 166% increase  
• 1.41-0.87 = 38.3% drop

  
**VET:**

• 0.057-0.152 = 166.7% increase  
• 0.152-0.086 = 43.4% drop

  
**XMR:**

• 180.5-320.4 = 77.5% increase  
• 320.4-217.7 = 32.1% drop

  
**EOS:** 

• 3.22-6.35 = 97.2% increase  
• 6.35-3.90 = 38.6% drop

  
**NEO:**

• 25.5-65.3 = 156% increase  
• 65.3-37.4 = 42.7% drop

  
I've omitted coins like ADA and SOL, which saw extreme appreciation due to FOMO - and thus would fall outside any pattern analysis.

For everyone except Monero (XMR), we saw a much faster rise and thus a greater distance between the low and high.

At the same time, everyone on this list, without exception, have dropped faster than Bitcoin.  


\------------------------------------------

**THIS MEANS 2 THINGS:**

1) ALT coins can make you richer or poorer much faster than BTC; buying at the right time can give you much larger gains.

2) Timing aforementioned ""right time"" is comparatively more dangerous, and most traders will only buy in to an ALT coin once there are more definite signs that it's on the rise. However, day traders will utilize a chop trade method, where 1-3% gain for each trade is the goal - not the huge 100-200% gains we could see over time.

If trying to swing trade during this bear market, do a thorough investigation and look at the graphs - and remember to zoom out.

BTC is currently down 21-23%. But it may drop much further - and the ALT coins as a result, could drop comparatively even further still.

I found a recent research article about the average amount that an american pays to McDonalds.

An average american pays $1200 annually which is $1200/12 = $100 monthly and $1200/52 = $23.31 weekly and $100/30 = $3.33 daily

So that means you can DCA weekly with a budget of $23.31 which is nice! So lets get to gains now!

1. If you'd bought Bitcoin every week for the last year, you would have $1,911.85 worth of Bitcoin today.

2. If you'd bought Ethereum every week for the last year, you would have $3,567.95 worth of Ethereum today.

3. If you'd bought Cardano every week for the last year, you would have $8,056.34 worth of Cardano today.

The picture you see is of cover protocol’s COVER token gaining 300% in a matter of minutes following days of 0 activity just days prior. 

This project is dead. The devs abandoned it and mentioned this in a tweet about a week ago asking all exchanges with the listing, including Binance, to stop all trading.

HOW THIS WORKS

1. In response to the series of bleak news surrounding cover protocol, after it got hacked, people started taking short positions. And finally, after the announcement of the project’s closure, short selling the token was literally like getting free money. Now this information of short positions held by people is known by Binance. To short a token you need a collateral to borrow that token against, in order to sell it in the market. If the collateral provided to borrow a token is not enough to offset the increase in price of said token, your collateral will be taken “liquidating” you to repay the loan. With a dead token like this, there shouldn’t be a possibility of it rising in price like that, right? Well, that’s only if you don’t consider that by stopping  margin selling and subsequent forced liquidations, anyone with a lot of money and information can literally steal your money. They deploy a large capital to buy the token-&gt; token price increases-&gt; liquidation engine uses collateral to buy back the token-&gt; price rises higher -&gt;more shorts get liquidated and so on. Once the dominos of liquidations is triggered, the price pumps itself. This is known as a 'short squeeze'. The buyer can then dump their coins at a profit.

2. The price pump is purposefully vertical in order to prevent people from providing more collateral in time to prevent their positions from being liquidated, which is the only option they have left, since opening a new short is not an option anymore after Binance had already disabled short selling immediately after the devs' tweet.

HOW I KNOW THIS IS MANIPULATION

1. this pump happened in response to no news or development whatsoever

2. The project is literally abandoned! 

3. Pump came conveniently right before market update notification (issued in apps) making COVER the top gainer 2 days in a row to attract more money.

4. The margin selling (shorting) of this token was stopped mere minutes after the announcement of the project’s closure and is still unavailable, but you’re still able to buy the token (Robinhood &amp; GameStop but in reverse)

WHY I THINK BINANCE IS INVOLVED

1. This incident is different from your average pump and dump which can be carried out by anyone, since, in this case, the only person with the power of stopping margin selling, is the exchange/broker Binance themselves. Until there is exculpatory evidence to the contrary, it is only natural to assume foul play by Binance for both their actions (stopping margin selling) and inactions (not disabling buying/trading, or informing the users).

2. The margin selling of the token was stopped immediately after Cover tweeted requesting all exchanges to stop trading activity and to direct all investors to their article. This indicates that Binance knew about it but did nothing to safeguard their users’ interests, but rather, took positive action to their detriment. The Cover/BUSD pair traded for over a week after its demise with not a single action being taken by Binance to prevent negative consequences.

3. The most laughable stuff was the notification from Binance 2 days in a row with the message “Cover skyrocketed 150%” after it was already dead for over a week. Funny when you already know the reality, infuriating if you think about the negligence on their part. Sure, stupid people fomo-ing in will lose money, but Binance owes responsibility to the users. I guess that doesn’t matter when millions are up for grabs. 

THE AFTERMATH

1. Cover had pledged the treasury to the investors, but I assume most of them lost money. FOMO-ing speculators, again, lost money. Short sellers got rekt.

2. On 17th  of September, Binance announced the delisting of the token. Saying they review their products periodically for quality in order to safeguard their users (lol). 

3. Bloomberg also launched a probe on September 17th into possible insider trading and price manipulation by Binance. 

4. I also held a short position which I took minutes after the news of the project shutting down. Since I expected exit pumps like this one, I dodged getting rekt within seconds of being liquidated. I will now be forced liquidated by binance and will end up with almost no profit or loss.

5. This incident probably won’t get much attention because barely anyone knew about this protocol and what came afterward. But it’s kind of amusing how blatant this manipulation is.

I’m not saying that Binance, specifically, is evil. I would assume all crypto exchanges are, to varying degrees. It’s one thing to be cognizant of this fact indifferently, and quite another to experience it first-hand.

This only gets worse when you combine the powers of a broker and an exchange into a single entity.

I don´t say negative by the healthy part but by the part when it comes to crypto and gains. You can easily live without fastfood but it is SO tempting to eat and buy, especially in the USA. (I Live in Belgium, and I eat twice a month McDonalds)

I found a recent research article about the average amount that an american pays to McDonalds.

An average american pays $1200 annually which is $1200/12 = $100 monthly and $1200/52 = $23.31 weekly and $100/30 = $3.33 daily

So that means you can DCA weekly with a budget of $23.31 which is nice! So lets get to gains now!

1. If you'd bought Bitcoin every week for the last year, you would have $1,911.85 worth of Bitcoin today.

2. If you'd bought Ethereum every week for the last year, you would have $3,567.95 worth of Ethereum today.

3. If you'd bought Cardano every week for the last year, you would have $8,056.34 worth of Cardano today.

So 365 days from now on, you missed a nice 6.5x on cardano! Imagine if you did this for 2 or 3 years straight. Are you going to DCA and fuck McDonalds or both, Eat McDonalds and DCA.

Idk the rules so i won't write his name anywhere unless i figure that out.. but about the evergrande event-


I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally… I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further.

I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally… I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!

Cardanos system mainframe just experienced a load droppage. (LD) occurs when cross hex rates intercept one another on nodes Q.42 throughout T.21.

Load droppage usually manifests on Hard Layers and sometimes Soft Layers. But loads being dropped on nodes is an anomaly in itself. We call these hard loads HL. As more Nodes will open their channel pathways to absorb more of the hard droppings.

(4000 tx a second)

**First, block propagation.** With graphene, a typical 1 GB block can be encoded in about 20 kB, most of which is order information. With a canonical ordering, that number should drop to about 5 kB. Sending 20 kB or 5 kB over the internet is pretty trivial, and should add about **1 second** total.

**Second, IBLT decoding.** I haven't seen any benchmarks for decoding the IBLTs in Graphene for 1 GB blocks, but in 2014 I saw some benchmarks for 1 MB blocks that showed decoding time to be around 10 ms. If it scales linearly, that would be **around 10 seconds** for decoding.

**Third, block sorting.** A 1 GB block would have about 2.5 million transactions. Assuming that we're using a canonical lexical ordering, we will need to sort the txids for those transactions. Single-threaded sorting is typically between 1 million keys per second and (for uint64_t keys) 10 million keys per second, so sorting should take around **1 second**.

**Fourth, computing and verifying the merkle root hash.** The amount of hashing needed to do this is equal to 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ... = 2 times the summed length of the txids, multiplied by two because we do two rounds of SHA256. With 2.5 million transactions, that's 320 MB of hashing. SHA256 can do around 300 MB/s on a single core, so this will take about **1 second**.

**Fifth, block validation**. This step is hard to estimate, because we don't have any good benchmarks for how an ideal implementation would perform, nor do we even have a good idea of what the ideal implementation would look like. Does the node have the full UTXO set in RAM, or does it need to do SSD reads? Are we going to shard the UTXO set by txid across multiple nodes? Are we using flash or Optane for the SSD reads and writes? But you said napkin, so here's a shot. A 1 GB block is likely to have around 5 million inputs and 5 million outputs. Database reads can be done as a single disk IO op pretty easily, but writes generally have to be done more carefully, with separate writes to the journal, and then to multiple levels of the database tree structure. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that each database write consists of four disk writes plus one disk read, or 5 ops total. This means that a 1 GB block will require around 10 million reads and 20 million writes. Current-gen m.2 PCIE NVMe top-of-the-line SSDs can get up to 500k IOPS. In two years, a good (but not top-end) SSD will probably be getting around 1 million random IOPS in both reads and writes. This would put the disk accesses at around **30 seconds** of delay. Sharding the database onto multiple SSDs or multiple nodes can reduce that, but I presume desktop computers won't have access to that. If we have Optane, the UTXO stuff should get way faster (10x? 50x?), as Optane has byte-level addressability for both reads and writes, so we will no longer need to read and write 4 kB blocks for each 30 byte UTXO. Optane also has much better latency, so a good database will be able to get lower write amplification without needing to worry about corruption.

**Zeroth, script verification**. This is generally done when a transaction hits mempool, and those validation results are cached for later use, so no substantial extra script verification should need to be done during block validation. All we need is to make sure AcceptToMemoryPool doesn't get bogged down in the 10 minutes before the block. A single CPU core can verify about 5000 p2pkh scripts (i.e. single ECDSA sigop) per second, so an 8-core desktop should be able to handle 40,000 p2pkh inputs per second. Verifying the 5 million inputs in advance should take 125 seconds out of our 600 second window. That's cutting our safety margins a bit close, but it's tolerable for a non-mission-critical min-spec machine. Because this is done in advance, that 125/600 seconds turns into **0 seconds** for the sake of this calculation.

**All told**, we have about (1 + 10 + 1 + 0.5 + 30) = **42.5 seconds** for a decent desktop to receive and verify a 1 GB block, assuming that all the code bottlenecks get fixed. There are probably a few other steps that I didn't think of, so maybe 60 seconds is a more fair estimate. Still, it's reasonable.

Miners will, of course, need to be able to receive and process blocks much faster than this, but they will have the funding to buy computers with much greater parallelization, so their safety margin versus what they can afford should be about the same as for a casual desktop user.



upstream bandwidth  largely depends on how many peers that our user has. Let's assume that our desktop user is a middle-class hobbyist, and is only sacrificing peer count a little bit in favor of reduced hardware requirements. Our user has 8 peers.

Transaction propagation comes from 3 different p2p messages. 

**The first message is the INV message**, which is used to announce that a node knows one or more transactions with a specified TXID or TXIDs. These INV messages are usually batched into groups of 3 or so right now, but in a higher-throughput context, would likely be batched in groups of 20. The TCP/IP and other overhead is significant, so an INV for a single TXID is around 120 bytes, and each additional TXID adds around 40 bytes (not the 32 byte theoretical minimum). With 20 tx per inv, that's 880 bytes. For each peer connection, half of the transactions will be part of a received INV, and half will be part of a sent INV. This means that per 2.5 million transactions (i.e. one block) per peer, our node would send and receive 55 MB. For all 8 peers, that would be **440 MB** in each direction for INVs.

**The second and third messages are the tx request and the tx response.** With overhead, these two messages should take around 600 bytes for a 400 byte transaction. If our node downloads each transaction once and uploads once, that turns into **1.5 GB** of traffic in each direction per block.

Lastly, we need to propagate the blocks themselves. With Graphene, the traffic needed for this step is trivial, so we can ignore it.

In total, we have **about 1.94 GB bidirectional** of traffic during each (average) 600 second block interval. That translates to average bandwidth of 3.23 MB/s or **25.9 Mbps**. This is, again, reasonable to expect for a motivated middle-class hobbyist around 2020, though not trivial.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3491020,public,self,Did you know Bitcoin can scale up to 4000 tx per second and still remain decentralised where full nodes can be run by hobbyists?

I keep seeing people post about Evergrande making interest payments on time and that the world is good again. I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a difference between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders. 

My guess at the end: some SOE banks come in with some package to save certain pieces of the above pie. Perhaps the CEO/management team gets reprimanded strongly? Either ways, this is the largest elephant in the room now and the Crypto market is worried of the repercussions and quakes that we could feel from this fallout.

That said... enough about Evergrande, Crypto is dealing with its own troubles. Messari's Mainnet event got hijacked by a SEC subpoena, Mr Gensler called stablecoins 'poker chips' (we get it), and Binance derivatives service got clamped down in Australia.

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity. Finally… I actually took Gary Gensler Washington Post interview early this morning to be bullish for Crypto long term. We certainly need certain aspects of the market to be reined in to progress further. Have a good one!

On-chain data wise: During the dip, BTC's LTH-SOPR (1.26) vs STH-SOPR (0.97) indicated short-term holders (speculators, swing-traders, etc.) sold into losses, while long-term holders took profit. Regardless, the stablecoin supply ratio fell, and the exchange reserves of BTC is nearing a six-month low. This suggest traders are flushed with cash, but whether they are willing to step in (presumably on long leverage positions) is another question. For the second day, BTC Long liquidation also indicated a sharp up spike relative to the past 12 days while the estimated leverage ratio hovered at the mid-point (relative to the past two weeks), suggesting a very risk-off environment.

In derivatives: BTC and ETH option contract open interest held constant while traders adopted a wait-and-see approach to prices. Options skew indicators reflect a different story: 25% delta skew (Volatility premium for puts to calls), a significant jump, reflecting a high belief among option traders that further downward movement is imminent. Coin days destroyed also show that the move was mostly driven by short-term traders. 

Personally, I like to fade such event-driven markets (but only post FOMC). Just note that conditions are primed such that if we get very positive news, people are flushed with cash for a jolt back to risk. A gentle nudge to also remember just how short-term market participant thinks, and that one only needs to look just over the ridge to stay ahead. IMO, the Evergrande fiasco is starting to look more like a very controlled detonation by the CCP - even if their offshore entity defaults (after the 30-day grace period), it won’t trigger a cross-default to its onshore entity.

Whether it's crypto or stocks, learning patience and how to best profit off of it is something that comes with experience and having a longer term view.

In 2018, did BTC crash from 20K to 3K in a day? It took MONTHS. That's why whenever I read these ""buy the dip"" posts on r/cc, I can't help but laugh and just roll my eyes. A 10% drop is really nothing... 

You're never going to time the exact bottom. But you can take a longer term approach and get in at a good lower price. 

Also, here's some practical advice. If you want to buy a dip, don't spend all your cash on one entry. You can split it over multiple amounts and timeframes. For example, if I wanted to buy yesterday, I could have taken 20% of my cash and bought. Then, I can wait a week or two (maybe even a month), and re-evaluate. If the price is lower, I can take 20% of my cash and buy more at an even better price! If it's up, I can decide what I want to do then. This is even better because I already have exposure to crypto, so I don't mind having some cash on hand to buy dips.

In regards to the current market situation, yes we don't know what's going to happen. Evergrande is the elephant in the room, and there should be some contagion effects from this fallout. September is historically a weak month. But from all of the market information that's available, I want to wait at least a few more weeks to see if we get another bigger pullback.

To summarize, it's not necessary to time and buy every dip. Once the bear market comes (and it will come), you'll have plenty of time to load your bags. It won't be the absolute bottom, but you'll be rewarded in the long haul.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490957,public,self,Most of the younger folks on r/cc could really benefit from a longer term view,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pszil7/most_of_the_younger_folks_on_rcc_could_really/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,261fc174-1507-11e4-8375-12313d224df5,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to work on a bulge bracket Asia HY bond desk and this is not the case. 

Twitter and the Media is missing the full picture and no one has pointed it out yet. 👇

We aren’t fully out of the woods. There is a different between onshore (denominated in CNY) and offshore bonds (USD). Evergrande has offshore coupon denominated in USD due Sep 23 and have yet to make an announcement on those. Given a choice, they would pay onshore first. Should they decide not to pay USD, this will hurt global investors regardless. That said, there is still a 30-day grace period so it’s not end of the world, even if they don’t. 

The CCP won’t directly step in but they will save the house buyers in the case of a default (so they don’t see any protesting etc). SOE banks will be the first to get screwed and majority of loans/commercial papers are to them. The scary part is that we’re not too sure how many of these guys re-levered this debt into other instruments so there may be ticking bombs all around. 

Ultimately, the nearest USD coupon that is due is on Sept 23rd (Thursday), roughly equating to US$100m in interest. Sure, you may meet that interest but the company still has $300bn of principal coupon worth to pay. 

Personally, I see a few routes moving forward but one needs to look at the debt structure (1). horizontally (time-based) and (2). vertically (who and what type of debt do they hold) to see a better picture.

Horizontally:
- Sept 23, $83mio in interest due
- Sept 29, $45mio in interest due
- Oct 11, $~160mio in interest due
- Nov 6, $80mio in interest due
- Dec 28, $250mio in interest due

Vertically:
- 54% of its $300bn are in secured borrowings
- 2% are convertible bonds (lower pecking order)
- 21% are senior notes (this is mostly held by UHNW individuals and big funds/banks)
- 6% PRC bonds (local onshore denominated debt)
- 17% Unsecured direct bank borrowings (mostly to SOE banks)

That said, my gutfeel is that the CCP will go in indirectly via the SOE banks taking the brunt of the hurt; they’ll likely working their butts off now with some meeting of sort with all EVERRE’s biggest debt/equity backers. The key players in this game are:

[In order of importance to the CCP]. 
1. People who bought homes (they will be taken care off first)
2. Suppliers and construction companies contracted (perhaps this may be next)
3. Public debt holders (UHNW/Funds/Banks) – the key people here are the funds/banks
4. SOE banks who provided direct loans (govt backed anyways)
5. Equity holders.

The slide took place near the close of the day on Sept. 21, with BTC prices having drawn down by 16% from nearly $47,300 at the start of the day, to tag a local low of $39,650 at roughly 9pm UTC. The move marked a 25% retracement from BTC’s local highs above $50,000 on Sept. 7.

However, the pullback comes after Bitcoin gained more than 80% since hitting $29,300 on July 20 and then heading into early-September’s highs. Bitcoin has since recovered to trade just above $42,000.

Bitcoin was not alone in suffering a sharp price decline on Sept. 21, with 29 of the top 30 crypto assets by market cap suffering a 24-hour drawdown according to CoinGecko.

According to the crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index, the bearish price action coincides with sentiment of “extreme fear” across the market. Just one month ago, the metric signaled “extreme greed.”

Some of crypto’s outspoken critics have seized on the dip to offer apocalyptic predictions for the markets, with “Mr. Whale” proclaiming to his 300,000 Twitter followers that “the bear market is here.”

Notorious gold shill Peter Schiff chimed in, forecasting that the growth of altcoins will soon “overwhelm demand” until “the crypto bubble pops, while Bitfinexed believes the credit woes of Chinese real estate giant Evergrande will threaten Tether’s reserves and the broader crypto markets through systemic risk.

The price plunge also came in the aftermath of SEC chairman Gary Gensler likening stablecoins to poker chips and calling for tightening regulation of the sector.

However, much of Crypto Twitter reports zealous dip-buying in response to the market action, with some analysts asserting Bitcoin is poised for a recovery should prices hold above local support.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz appeared on CNBC to offer that he won’t be feeling “nervous” unless BTC fails to hold above $40,000 and Ether crashes below $2,800. “As long as those [price levels] hold, I think the market’s in good shape,” he added.“

Novogratz is not alone in eying the roughly $40,000 level as a critical support zone for BTC, with popular analyst William Clemente III recently asserting that Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $39,000 due to its liquid supply floor.

Looking toward the fourth-quarter, influencer Lark Davis notes that the final quarter of both 2013 and 2017 saw rallies of more than 300% respectively as past bull cycles crescendoed, and speculated the possible approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could again send prices flying.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490892,public,self,"The price of Bitcoin has slumped below $40,000 for the first time in six weeks.

Some of my cryptos are still in red but others never went below my buying price which was nice. Overall, it looks like that the market found its support level.

The unique website [IPv6 Token](https://IPV6Token.com) is to *Bypass corporate VPNs to access the blockchain, Secure and hidden transactions via Private Channels.* IPv6 Token website is known to be a  *Direct packet-to-blockchain access with Undetectable and asymmetrical encryption. Native IPv6 network-based crypto market data.* This website was specially designed with the potential to give full details about the crypto market data, transaction, contracts function. It is also used for swapping &amp; NFTs with a P2P direct send.

IPv6 was recently launched in 2021 and is now available for use, the website ipv6 platform is quite easy to use for both amateurs and professionals. All you need to do is just to follow all necessary procedures as in the platform. A 24 hrs customer support was also provided in case users got lost or needed quick help with the platform. 

**STEGANOGRAPHY- The Practice Of Concealing Messages Or Information Within Other Non-Secret Text Or Data.**

As stated, the IPv6 Token project aims to bring the blockchain lower in the stack, more specifically on the IP/Transport layer (IPv6 protocol). The platform is also connected to Steganography which is the science of hiding messages in unsuspected places, in each case, were hiding the blockchain in IPv6 Custom Extension Headers. These headers can contain bits of information that can be encrypted.

Nevertheless, you can even break up your message, like a signed Ethereum transaction, into multiple packets and hidden inside multiple IPv6 packet headers. 

IPv6 Token Project aims to standardize native IPv6 Crypto Headers

Currently, blockchain interaction lives on layer 7, which is typically blocked by corporate networks and also is easier to attack with MITM (man in the middle). Using IPV6 (Internet Protocol) brings numerous advances to communication, most importantly, encrypted custom headers. Two parties are also able to use steganography (the science of hiding messages) in custom destination headers to secure interactions.

Here's one thing we know for sure: China is led by an authoritarian regime. Consequently, other than the Politburo, noone knows how much debt exists and where it ties to.

By looking through a financial lens, it's really tough to predict what the Politburo will decide.

Let's look through an international political lens:

Within international relations, authoritarian regimes overly respect hard power (military might) and are usually more inward concerning than most modern democracies. 

As a direct result from the USD being America's #1 export, stemming from the Nixon gold standard withdrawal, American hegemony has slowly waned. Yet, the collective of Western Democracy still stymies China's hegemonal quest. Militarily, any Chinese advance to hegemony would be quickly squashed. Nuclear war also doesn't make sense (MAD). China's economy is starting to show signs of slowdown and their population is set to half by 2100.  China is running out of time to establish China as the next great world superpower and Xi Jiping knows it.

So what is an authoritarian regime to do?

Economic Warfare

Authoritarian regimes have more flexibility domestically because they're not democratically gridlocked nor internationally responsible. This means he can gracefully manage economic fallout domestically while maximizing damage abroad. XI has already been decoupling the Chinese economy with his 2015 agenda (China 2025 Plan). Trump accelerated this decoupling. And because of all the uncertainties surrounding the situation, Xi can claim any number of plausible excuses if the international community cries foul. Side note, this is why international cyber warfare is so effective and unmitigated.

If Xi can cause Western Democratic economies to attenuate, escape negative consequences internationally while gracefully managing the economic fallout domestically, he wins this zero-sum game. Furthermore, he can further the influence of his Silk Road initiatives. And he becomes a rockstar domestically.

TL;DR If Xi can do economically destroy the world and survive, he'll do it.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490792,public,self,China's Evergrande Vision,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psyggy/chinas_evergrande_vision/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They all work. If you haven't invested more than you can lose, and you aren't an emotional investor, there are TONS of ways to profit from this dip. There are also tons of ways to hedge against a further dip.

Although somewhere towards the end, he did break his ice by saying that due to the high gas fee projects are moving towards the centralised and single team controlled blockchains like Solana ;).

Link to the video: https://youtu.be/pk1MyzlhBJk

Back to the video, he starts with the introduction of what an on-chain analysis is and how we can track the crypto currency metrics real time. Here is his definition -  “on-chain analysis involves tracking cryptocurrency transactions”.  Probably some of us already knew and have been checking/tracking the holders count, funds movements and top wallets in etherscan.io but not everyone. 

He then covers on-chain analysis for the large cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge coin etc. He mentions that we can use https://bitinfocharts.com for a few key on-chain metrics. Some of them are, how the coins are distributed. He gives an example by comparing BTC distribution with DOGE’s where top wallet of the DOGE contains majority of the coins which can bring the price down when the top wallet decides to sell. He also talks about multi signature wallets which are typically used by the institutional  investors, monitoring these wallets will also give insights about what’s going on. 

He goes on to talk about analysis for mid/small alt coins where he mentions to do your best to find as many blockchain explores as possible for the crypto currency. He reasons that default blockchain explorers doesn’t show all the metrics. This is in fact true, if you see any of the Solana explorers (tools), you can hardly find any info about holders. He mentions that if the project is legit they shouldn’t hide any info from their hodlers (provided the blockchain ecosystem has correct tools in the first place). 

He explains on-chain analysis for the proof of stake, he mentions that sometimes staking contracts may hide real distribution of a coin or token as its hard to figure out which wallet owns the staked coins. This will have a huge effect on the price as someone can unstake and sell on the market. This is a huge risk for Cardano as there is no unbounding period, one can unstake and sell immediately. This is safe with other blockchains like Crypto.org Chain, Polkadot etc. where they have unbouding period of 28 days, that means one can’t be able to sell for at least 28 days from performing the unstaking. 

Next, he turns his attention to how an on-chain analysis can be performed for the Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. He states that exchange balance is the criteria, low exchange balance means there will be a higher price volatility. He mentions that “Even though the crypto market hasn’t been looking all that hot lately, exchange balances of BTC and ETH continue to drop”

He finally talks about Validators, Hash rate and Nodes. He mentions that becoming a validator requires a lot of time, effort and money and if not careful validators get slashed. When there are more validators showing interest for a given proof of stake blockchain that means that there are many rich people who believe in the long-term potential of the project. He then explains what is an Has rate - “hash rate is basically the amount of computing power connected to a cryptocurrency blockchain”. He mentions that there is relatively high correlation with the price of the coin being mined. He then talks about set up of the crypto mining operation and how expensive is to run one.  	


Good Stuff: 
1. Some interesting points about how an on-chain analysis can be performed. E.g: Looking for the wallet address in google, using some free/ paid tools. 
2. How the on-chain analysis is different for various Blockchains (for Proof of Work, Proof of Stake etc..)
3.  What does moving in/out of funds from exchange means to the over all crypto market. 
4.  Touch ups on Validators, Hash Rate &amp; Mining Operations. 
5. On-chain analysis for the proof of stake and how blockchains not having unbouding period can have serious impact on the prices.  
6. These tools can’t be taken for granted as we never know what can happen in the Crypto market. 

Not so good Stuff:
1. Chrome/Firefox extension downloads of a wallet can’t be taken as a tangible metric, as it can easily be altered. 
2. He didn’t convey that there are now AMM solutions which can be used by whales to off load their bags into stable coins without going to any centralised exchanges. 


Final Verdict: 
It’s an interesting video for a little to medium tech savvy people to use the mentioned on-chain analysis tools for understanding the dynamics of the market. Its a must watch. For advance blockchain users, you know what to do ;).

My question is, say you have coin **A** which shoots up over 5 years and you now have $1 million worth of it. What should you do? Keeping all that worth in the same coin might be a liability once it reaches that market cap because if there is a good dip in coin **A** then you might lose a lot.  

Should you split it and swap some of **A** into coins **B, C, D, E,** etc.. to reduce your liability -- or should you cash out and keep it in the bank? Should you split it to coins that can be staked like ADA or SOL to get a passive income?

-------------------
I truly believe in crypto. I believe that crypto has the ability to become a universal currency that is borderless and controlled by the people; that will bank the unbanked; and so much more. 

I know that we are in the infancy stages of whatever crypto is to be. But there is nothing normal about what has happened in the last 6 months. Or the last 3 weeks. And especially the last 24 hours. 

But...

I have been day trading the last 3 months. More like 24/7. And all of my gains to try to stay above water (in the green) were wiped out since I went to sleep last night. All of it. 

I sincerely believe I am good at day trading. I know I'll recover in the next week doing what I do. And I'll be okay.

But this isn't about me. 99% of you are HODLing or buying more. 

3 weeks ago everyone bought the dip when coins such as Neo dropped from 70$ish to 50$ish. Now it has dropped from 50$ish to 30$ish. VET went from almost 16 cents to 12 cents. ADA did its own dip playing something like 25% then followed with the dip. 

History has shown that if you bought anything other than BTC and ETH and a few handful of alt coins during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, you lost a lot of money if you didn't trade or DCA. 

This isn't a post about BTC or ETH. 

It is a post about the event volatility in crypto. 

In my entire life, I have never experienced anything like this. 

I have never gambled but I think this is like gambling. But the crazy thing is:

So my sensing is that this [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) is real shady and am trying to do some due diligence before deciding on the next course of action.  


**Background**  
\- Friend (from singapore) has little to no prior experience with crypto; meets this person online from HK (person A) whom proceeds to share know-how.

\- Friend starts trading crypto using crypto exchange Upbit (South Korean based exchange)

\- Person A says that Upbit has been hacked and is no longer working well - proceeds to ask friend to use crypto exchange [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc). 

\- Friend decides to transfer funds out of [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) using bank transfer but did not receive funds and checks in with customer service who then proceeds to verify bank account details and eventually finding out that the bank account details given are wrong. (Contained 1 extra digit)

\- Customer service then informs friend that the transferred amount is stuck in a 3rd party payment processing system and has to **top-up** (not a payment) 30% of the transfer fee into [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) as USDT in order to move the funds back to the exchange (as part of some anti-money laundering procedure). A timeline of 1 week was given (states that the payment processing system will only retain pending transactions for a week)

&amp;#x200B;

**Checks**

\- Have requested friend to check in with Upbit Singapore to validate if her credentials reside with them

\- To check with Upbit if the anti-money laundering processes are valid and true

\- So was also trying to ensure that the funds can be moved out after getting the money back into the exchange by testing the following;

\- Did a test transfer from [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) to Binance (USDT using TRN network) and successful

\- Did a test transfer from [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) to Binance (USDT using ERC network) but failed as not supported according to customer service team.

\- Going to validate [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) deposit address and the address which I received the USDT in Binance are the same to ascertain that it is not manually acted upon by someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to see what everyone's thoughts are as this [upbitcoin.cc](https://upbitcoin.cc) feels scammy to me.. with a really badly built web-app which is  quite unlikely for a crypto exchange? The fear is that it is just a shell exchange and that the successful transfers are just a bid to build our confidence in topping up that extra 30% fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is able to share their past experiences with upbitcoin.cc; that will be super useful too!

So as we've seen the the daily reverse repo has been growing and growing. Banks have also had the issue of too much cash. 

Banks have too much cash on their hands - and they're running out of places to put it. Nowhere is this more evident than in the rising popularity of a Federal Reserve program that lets firms stash their cash overnight with the U.S. central bank in exchange for at best a small return. The payout these days: Zero percent. https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tsunami-cash-is-driving-rates-ever-lower-what-will-fed-do-2021-06-03/

So how do they fix this??? 

Well enter Basel. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters. 

Yesterday they announced their recommendations to banks for handling the future of this crypto. One of them being... 

The rules suggest that banks overcollateralize their crypto holdings by 1250% to avoid insolvency.

The Basel Committee would slap those Group 2 assets with a 1,250% risk weight when calculating a bank’s capital levels (a key measure of a firm’s health calculated as its assets minus its liabilities).

Higher risk weights require a bank to hold more capital against those holdings to insulate the firm’s depositors from any losses that may come from holding those assets.

I was confused on the checkbox on Coinbase’s “Deposit XRP” screen that says “I have sent XRP to the address above and included the XRP tag (if required)”. I saw that Nexo had that field as optional. So I thought “ok, it’s not required (by Nexo) so we’re good.” I copied my CB Wallet address, provided it to Nexo, and initiated the withdrawal. Nexo sent my XRP to the wallet address and the transaction was successful on the ledger. Then my XRP never showed up. I misunderstood the screen on Coinbase, and now my coins are “lost” - but *where* are they lost?

Since the transaction was successful on the XRP ledger, coinbase received the coins but without the tag can’t allocate it to my account. So…does coinbase just *keep* my coins?",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490629,public,self,Exchanges requiring Destination Tags: where do the coins go if you don’t provide a tag?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psxhi2/exchanges_requiring_destination_tags_where_do_the/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My move will be to buy 10k worth of Eth, SNX, ICX, REN. 

REN was over a dollar just a week ago.  

If you think DEFI will be a huge industry then you wont go wrong with this investment. Darkpool of crypto 😉

It allows DeFi projects to bring foreign cryptocurrency assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Zcash (ZEC) to their offerings. More broadly, users can in essence swap any token between any two blockchains without middle steps such as using so-called “wrapped” versions of tokens, for example Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).

SNX - had an all time high of 26 and is sitting at 9.5 now after a 10% drop in the last 24 hours. 

The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for third-party facilitators.

SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract. 

Wallstreet will be eating these up once they move into crypto. 

Max supply is 215 M standing at 1.127 B market cap. 

ICX has been on a run for the few weeks until the recent dip. It is sitting at  1.552 with ATH of 10.59. 

ICON Network describes itself as a general-purpose blockchain protocol based on the native cryptocurrency ICX that can run smart contracts, adopt the BFT-DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) consensus protocol, and use an economic-governance protocol called DPoC (Delegated Proof-of-Contribution). The ICON Network is powered by a proprietary blockchain engine called 'loopchain' and has the ability to handle hundreds of transactions per second. The ICON project was started to ensure the integrity and transparency of data shared between institutions and companies, and to move mutual assets on heterogeneous blockchains without a centralized organization. In the long term, ICON Network aims to become an 'interchain' that connects multiple blockchains based on BTP tech. 

ETH well its ETH and who can pass up buying it for less then 3k 

I will probably be holding these for at least 3 years. 

I am also transferring 5k into my account and will be buying more if the dip continues.

Vid info:

Here we have a flash loan borrowed 3,157.41 BNB from Multiplier-Finance to make an arbitrage trade on the AMM DEX PancakeSwap. First part of the arbitrage is to convert BNB to BUSD using BurgerSwap contract. The arbitrage converts BUSD for BNB using BUSD/BNB PancakeSwap, and then immediately converts BNB back to 3,168.39 BNB using BNB/BUSD BakerySwap. After the arbitrage, 3,168.38 BNB is returned back to Multiplier to pay the loan plus fees. This transaction costs around 0.2 BNB of gas. Please note that the transaction sender (Us) gains 2.51 BNB from the arbitrage. 

This method can be repeated all the time until the limit is reached as price changes all the time.

STEPS: Before your start, you need to install and setup MetaMask in your Chrome/Firefox Browser. You need to have BNB in your Metamask Wallet, using the BEP20(BSC) Network, not BEP2! Follow this instruction on connecting MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain -https://academy.binance.com/en/articl...

1. Open and setup Remix in browser (https://remix.ethereum.org) 
2. Copy the Contract code at - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q...
3. Create new file in Remix and paste Contract code and wait for everything to load 
4. Enter your token details and deploy your contract 
5. Get the Contract address from Remix 
6. Send 0.2 BNB to the contract for gas fee for all swaps (There are going to be many swaps to use all funds from out liquidity pools. So, its going to take around 0.2 BNB fees) 
7. Call 'flashloan' function in Remix.

**********************************************************************************If it fails, repeat the TX again WITH 31560 GAS LIMIT AS SEEN IN THE VIDEO

**********************************************************************************Example: 

To attempt a flash loan of 5,000 BNB(The minimum Flashloan amount by Multiplier Finance is 1000BNB) You have to use a gas fee of at least 1 BNB(0.20 BNB per every 1000 BNB) IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH GAS, THE FLASHLOAN WILL FAIL!

Add at least 0.20 BNB gas (0.30 is better) in each transaction (Per 1000 Loan amount)

The amount you can earn varies and depends on the arbitrary differences in the liquidity of the pool.

If the contract is unable to make a profit from the pool and repay the flashloan whilst pocketing the profits all in one single transaction, then the transaction will revert as if nothing happened which is the nature of flash loans.

The higher the flash loan, the better chances of being able to execute a profitable flash loan attack, which is why we see flash loan attackers doing millions at a time. A flash loan of 5,000 BNB or higher is almost guaranteed to work every time but occasionally lower amounts such as the one demonstrated in the video can work too.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490580,public,self,Is this a legit contract??

In this article, "" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both said they would divest any holdings of individual stocks by Sept. 30 and put the proceeds into index funds or cash. ""

"" It also triggered a record surge of asset prices following a crash early in the pandemic. Between the Fed's efforts and trillions of dollars in government spending approved by Congress, the S&amp;P 500 Index [**(.SPX)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPX) has more than doubled from its pandemic low on March 23, 2020 and is about 30% above the high hit in the previous month.

* Ban (unapproved) stablecoins outright. Given that a CBDC is coming that will probably be all of them.
* Penalize privacy coins and mixers
* Label smart contracts that take longer than 24 hours to complete as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly
* Authorize the creation of a digital dollar CBDC in which all transactions are recorded
* Absolutely fucking wreck our shit

It's hard to overstate how detrimental this would be to crypto. This would blow an enormous hole in defi and the rest of the cryptocurrency space, and put a huge handicap on it's ability to recover. Even you maxis who are looking at this thinking this might be a good thing really gotta think long and hard about how insanely bad this will be even for BTC and ETH. What is BTC really worth without liquidity from stablecoins and the all of the other cryptocurrencies? What is ETH really worth without defi? This would be insanely bad for crypto and we need to do everything in our power to stop it. At the current moment, this means contacting each of the members of these committees to tell them to oppose this devastating draconian measure. Detailed explanation of bill and how to contact the representatives included in the video below, starting at 6:40 timestamp. If you're in the US and you're invested at all in cryptocurrency please take the time to do this!!!! The best easiest way to kill this bill is here in committee before it can get to the house floor.

I am concerned by one particular contradiction within Gary Gensler’s narrative and am reaching out to our community to help me understand better, or obtain new context.

Each of these policy makers (Yellen, Warren, and Gensler) advocate for “investor protection” and lean back on historical precent in support of this stated goal.

Maybe I am just spectral or overreactive, but listening to Gensler today, I was confused by this statement:

Gensler: “Not many have and i do really fear that we’ll keep bringing these enforcement cases, but there’s going to be a problem, there’s going to be a problem with lending platforms, with trading platforms, and frankly when that happens i think a lot people are going to get hurt” (13:38)

What is more likely is that Evergrande is being used to leverage a narrative, and distract people from what is honestly a more important event; the Fed decision on whether they will begin to ""taper"" the economy, or remain in a state of Quantitative Easing. For those of you not familiar with the concept:

  
QE helps **the economy by reducing the long-term interest rates**, thus making business and mortgage borrowing cheaper thus giving a signal that the US Fed wants to support the economy. Tapering is the gradual slowing of the pace of the Fed's large scale asset purchases.

This decision tomorrow will be the confirmation most of the big players need to be sure there's more gas in the tank for the bull run. If the Fed mentions tapering, then we will see the sharp drop everyone expects from this Evergrande news.

Evergrande's loan payment is due on the sept 23rd, and they have publicly stated they cannot guarantee they can repay it. 

If the CCP does not bail them out, it will have a snowball effect on other companies, creating a staggering amount of liquidations. This could result in significant drops in cryptocurrency prices over time. 

Already more than $1 billion was liquidated in this 24 hour period, bringing the total liquidation in 48 hours to more than $2.5 billion.

Furthermore, the Chinese exchanges will open at 6:30 p.m. PST. You may notice a significant drop at that point, which may or may not worsen as their trading day progresses. The panic will hit us then. 

Right now we don’t know how far we are going to slide. It is a huge risk to hold the bag while big whales dump on us. It might be wisest to liquidate before China markets open, and DCA once we start seeing some real buy signals and not just dead cat bounces.

They can be hacked- [https://www.wired.com/story/cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets-can-get-hacked-too/](https://www.wired.com/story/cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets-can-get-hacked-too/)

If someone sees a ledger they know what it is, making it a massive target for a wrench attack. It's helpfully written on the side so they can google it.

Metamask can still be compromised with a ledger, according to their sub - not a ledger issue but doesnt stop attacks that paste addresses.

I have to physically bring it anywhere to make transactions. What if I'm on holiday or working away?

iPhone - non-custodial hot wallet like [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)

No one knows I have crypto here, its a phone.

iPhone hacks are pretty rare. As I keep a wallet I don't download dodgy apps or click on links.

If a hacker gets access to my phone they still cant access the wallet without biometric id or passcode.

For defi I can use wallet directly, not transferring to Metamask.

In both cases the main attack vector is user error. I need to keep my 12 or 24 word seed phrase safe from prying eyes. I just don't see how a hardware wallet is so much better for this.

So here is some advice that will seem stupid and obvious but I had to learn the hard way. 


If you see a coin drop 10% in a day and you throw $100 down just for it to drop 10% the next day and for you to drop another $100 and down another 5% the next you aren’t buying the dip. You’re chasing the dip and wasting money. I made this mistake earlier in March


If you want to buy the dip wait for prices to stable and hold for at least 2 days at around 1-2% fluctuation. This will prevent you from spending all your money buying the top of the dip. 


This also works when prices are rising you might see a coin go up 30% and think you need to jump in now because its going to the moon. This happened with ALGO last week when it hit $2.50 I said wait a few days for prices to stable and 3 days later prices dropped down and held around $2.00 and I picked up $100 worth (this was before the news our of china)

It’s easier to say that it acts like your bank account number. But the bafflement emerges when you see bitcoin address formats starting at 1, 3, or bc1. *What the heck are the differences?*

## Legacy Address

This is the original bitcoin address format proposed by the creator of bitcoin, [Satoshi Nakamoto. ](https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshi-nakamoto-founder-of-bitcoin/)It consists of alphanumeric characters which can be in uppercase or lowercase letters.

**Key notes:**

* legacy address starts with 1 e.g. 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2
* also called P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) which means[ the recipient sign a signature calculated from the private key and the public key. ](https://changelly.com/blog/bitcoin-addresses-types-and-meaning/)
* legacy address transactions are larger in size so you will be paying higher transaction fees
* can receive btc from a segwit btc address but can’t send to a segwit address unless allowed by the hardware or software wallets and exchange wallets
* case sensitive

## P2SH Bitcoin Address

P2SH stands for pay to script hash. It is the most widely supported bitcoin address format and can also be used to send bitcoins to both legacy and bech32 address. 

**Key notes:**

* starts with 3 e.g. 3P14159f73E4gFr7JterCCQh9QjiTjiZrG
* enables multi-signature authorization to process transactions
* also known as nested segwit 
* can save you some transaction fees

## Bech32 Bitcoin address

&amp;#x200B;

[Bech32 stats](https://preview.redd.it/hmsj0op47yo71.png?width=2846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aece8bbe145e810e41827851b4dd12386b9cf52c)

Bech32 bitcoin address is not as widely used as legacy and nested segwit-p2sh addresses. However, the numbers of people using it are continuously growing, because it saves you money when it comes to transaction fees! Yes, better than P2SH address.

**Key notes:**

* starts with bc1 prefix e.g **bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq**
* also called as the native segwit address or P2WPKH (Pay To Witness Public Key Hash)
* bech32 bitcoin address has paved the way for lightning network ⚡️
* sending funds from a segwit address is lower and transactions are faster
* sending funds from a bech32 address to a legacy address is possible but sending from a legacy address to bech32 will depend on your software, hardware, or exchange wallet if they allow it or not
* less prone to errors as all characters are in lowercase and more human-readable

## The Verdict

Out of all these three bitcoin address formats, it is ideal to use bech32 **for faster and lesser transaction fees.** This also means more transactions can be processed in a block. However, at the moment, it is more convenient to use the nested Segwit P2SH address, since it is more widely used and not all wallets support sending to a bech32 bitcoin address format.

Personally, I have both, but I highly recommend bech32 address instead, so we can make it to a 100% adoption. If you want to know who supports Bech32 address format, [check this out.](https://whensegwit.com/#who)

I aid the Senator and her policy team on banking and finance issues.

 

Out of the hundreds of amendments filed by members during consideration of the infrastructure bill, only a couple that pertained to cryptocurrency regulation were raised for a vote.  Senator Wyden’s amendment, which was adopted, would require reporting on “large financial account balances” to the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of ensuring people pay what they owe but doesn’t define what a large account balance is.  Due to lack of specificity in the language of Senator Wyden’s amendment, Senator Murkowski voted “no.”  Ultimately, the amendment was agreed to by a 50 to 49 vote along party lines. 

 

Senator Toomey’s amendment focused on the definition of a “broker” with respect to digital asset reporting requirements by third-parties.  The language defined a broker as someone who conducts transactions on exchanges where crypto assets are being bought and sold.  By narrowing the definition, miners, stakers, and other validators would not be subject to the new IRS reporting requirements outlined in the infrastructure bill.  An attempt by Senator Toomey to bring the amendment up for a vote by unanimous consent was blocked by Senator Sanders, and it was not raised for a roll call vote.  Senator Murkowski was prepared to vote in favor of this amendment because it seemed to satisfy most members, the Department of the Treasury, and the cryptocurrency industry – in a balance.

 

Again, thank you for contacting the office of Senator Murkowski.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

5 days ago I saw the news (pretty sure someone posted in this sub, saw it on ‘rising’) and I finally pulled up enough courage to say “I can play the market” and sold all my Bitcoin. Now I don’t have a ton or anything, but enough for it to be a very significant amount to me.

Since, I’ve been reading the news constantly, even more than the charts. I figured, based on the news and actually people in this subs comments, not necessarily my own intuition, that there’s be a dip when the Hong Kong opened, then again when the Chinese markets just opened.

Well it paid off, I waited up 9am Beijing time and pulled the trigger. Went fully back in.

I’m proud of myself that I did it, and I wanted to share that. I am not a financial savvy person, I know enough to get by alright. This was the first time “timing the market” ever crossed my mind.

But GOLLY did I get such a high from this past hour watching the charts and waiting for a dip that I was expecting/hoping.

Just a reminder that paying attention and keep your eyes and ears open can pay off sometimes.

I do definitely consider myself lucky that it worked, but I digress.

I’d like to shout out this sub for helping me summon the courage to make a move like that, and for all the discussions I’ve had this week with people in the comments of this sub for helping me make a decision that I’m really proud of.

1. The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.

2. The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.

3. The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.

4. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.

5. The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.

6. If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.

I feel as though in the past few years these have become outdated and need addressing by the space

1. is it a cryptocurrency if it maintained by a central authority? eg BNB? if BNB isnt a cryptocurrency then what do you call it? - Binance calls it a cryptocurrency

2. in our new space of wrapping tokens and as we sit on the edge of full interoperability and network bridges, are ""wrapped tokens"" running on a centralised chain a cryptocurrency, even though they are backed by a decentralised chain? if not what do you call it?

No, there isn't just ONE way to profit off a dip. DCA isn't ""the only way"". Neither is selling now and jumping back in when it drops another 30%. Nor is swing trading while it dips further and further. Or even HODLing.

They all work. If you haven't invested more than you can lose, and you aren't an emotional investor, there are TONS of ways to profit from this dip. There are also tons of ways to hedge against a further dip.

The more you keep telling people ""don't do x, do y"", the stupider you look. Half of you don't even realise that right now an ADA/ETH trade is near an ATH if you believe in ETH over ADA. But you keep telling people ""HODL"" and ""DCA"" because it's the only things you've heard parroted to you.

Stop giving investment advice and telling people there's only one way to go. Every tactic works if you aren't an idiot. The markets can still dip another 50% overnight.

# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*

 

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3490196,public,self,What's DeFi Systematic Risks ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psuso8/whats_defi_systematic_risks/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is the best approach in a scenario like this? What I found to work best is this: **never blow your load on the first dip** but instead DCA in the dip. So for example, let's say you have 1K to spend:

The price dips 10%, great buy $250 of your favorite crypto.  
The price dips ANOTHER 10%, great buy $250 of your favorite crypto.  
The price dips ANOTHER 10%, great buy $250 of your favorite crypto.  
The price dips ANOTHER 10%, great buy $250 of your favorite crypto.

You will eventually run out of money, but that's ok. You would have either way, but instead of dropping that 1K all at once on the first dip now you average down your holding, buying more crypto in the process. There is also a chance that after 1 or 2 dips the price recovers, that's ok too. Eventually it will dip again, and you get back in again.

I am currently 21 and a broke psychology student trying to become a psychotherapist ( I am saying this because it means I won't have any significant Income for a very long time)

I started with the normal stock market, where I just straight went for a globally diversified ETF by vanguard and that's it. I liked it that simple and it made sense to me.

Then I considered that I am still young and the money I am investing is spare cash anyway and with the small amounts I am using it won't really matter if I make even 12% in a year. So I decided to add some risk to my portfolio. I looked at normal sfocks for a second but nah I couldn't really find anything that stood out to me. 

So that's what brought me here just about a month ago, 10% is the amount I decided to expose to the crypto market.

Well this crypto world is quite fascinating and I got hooked up with a lot of projects quickly. The problem being I started with alt coins since I decided I am just gonna buy a couple and then I am gonna DCA into BTC and ETH and forget about it. 

The stock market quite irritated me I didn't know why it would spike so crazy after covid and couldn't come up with a proper reason so I figured it's overvaluated.  Therefore I decided to buy more crypto because it would probably recover faster even if a market crash would mean the same for crypto.

I then decided to spend 1000€ on crypto for now and then just DCA portions into ETH, BTC and my ETF. 

Well the main problem is that I am left here sitting with small bags of ATOM ADA DOT ALGO LINK ERG and well no real money left to buy the probably upcoming dips. Now I am not gonna sell these since I believe in the projects but not sure if they all gonna survive a proper bear market if that's where we headed.

Tbh this is just a rant about not having enough left to buy the dip. Don't be stupid just DCA and to be honest I would take it a step further and say plan every investment desicion and stick to the plan. I had a lot of freetime and I went looking into projects and buying coins like it's grocery shopping because I set these 1000€ out to be a learning experience. 

I now know a lot more about exchanges, wallets, security , taxes  and all for a relatively small cost.

&amp;#x200B;

We started just under 3 years ago as a VERY humble project with absolutely zero funding and completely based on reddit posts and a basic website/social media. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today we are a fully established 501c3 organization (non-profit registered by the irs) that is leading this niche category.   


You might be wondering - why is this organization necessary if there are homeless shelters and food kitchens? 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because 90% of the homeless people absolutely do not utilize ANY of those services for many many reasons (too far from their preferred area to pan-handle, disqualified due to addictions, places are too unsanitary/infested with bed bugs, lack of knowledge of location, mental/physical handicaps, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

We distinguish ourselves in that we do what most other charities do not do. We crowd fund without wasting a single penny on advertising, we have zero overhead/maintenance fees and use the funds for food. We HAND DELIVER the food to the homeless in the most difficult to reach areas in the city (yes I've gone to the dangerous areas under the bridge many times to hand the homeless people pizza). 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/5kkC7pM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5kkC7pM.jpg) \- this is a collage of images from earlier today to give an example of what we do.

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteers:

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking for regular/consistent volunteers (but even if you can only go out once it is still something we are looking for). If you are able to buy/hand out food and document everything exactly like how we do it on our websites/social media, you will be reimbursed 100% for the cost of food.

&amp;#x200B;

We've had several redditors volunteer for us and get reimbursed who can vouch for our integrity as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Full time workers:  


we are ALSO looking for full time workers (30 hours a week, work from home) 

we have various positions available, but they will mainly be related to social media, engagement, recruitment, etc. Currently, I have 2 positions open for this - so please message me if you are serious about it and we can proceed with a conversation/interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our organization QUALIFIES FOR PSLF (public service loan forgiveness) - meaning if you work for us for 10 years and make 120 qualifying payments towards your student loans, the rest of your student loans will be forgiven. HUGE incentive to help out the homeless and get your loans paid off.

I look my income in a completely different way, and it's been the most positive change imaginable. 

I'm more aware of the small, unnecessary purchases I was making. I'm budgeting seriously for the first time in my adult life, rather than just sinking money into my whims (early 30's). Everything I can reasonably stand to lose goes directly into my crypto accounts now.

I would enjoy the occasional smoke, and would always have a pack of cigarettes somewhere in the house. In Australia, that's about $45 a pop. A few months ago I went to buy a new pack, and I just couldn't do it! That was ~$45 i could invest into crypto! I hardly miss smoking at all now, and just love being able to slowly and steadily put small pieces of my paycheck into crypto instead.

If the mantra is ""buy and HODL"" and the average person isn't ""day trading""; why all the chatter about dips?

In my humble opinion anything shorter than a 90day chart when considering if your cost basis is justified by the market is overkill. You don't need to consider the hourly or daily price when you DCA or limit buy at prices you're comfortable with when thinking about the long term (whether that be a few months or  years or whatever in your case). 

Zooooom Out!!!

If you plan on holding for 5 years should the last hr, day, week really matter to you? If it does you're probably over leveraged (a la can't afford to HODL).

I don't want to rant without dropping a strategy though so here's some advice for those that want to feel a little more comfortable with their cost basis:

First keep track of your cost basis - use a spread sheet or one of many apps out there. I use Google Sheets. If you have not been tracking cost basis up to now you can calculate it by dividing your total amount invested by your total coin/token held. 

I like to use 90day charts for buying(and selling when not looking to hold long term). It most cases i expect to sell within those 90days or do cost basis averaging(which is not to be confused with DCA). 

I set a limit buy around the 90day low. Depending on precieved momentum or buy pressure it may be below or above but not by much. If it is a coin/token i plan to hold i repeat this process every time I have fiat to invest in said coin/token. If I plan to sell i set a limit sell at close to the 90day high; again depending on precieved momentum or sell pressure. For some i plan to hold longer and want to get more of or may be on the fence about holding ill sell half or enough to get my initial investment and either reinvest later via DCA or repeat the 90day strategy.

That being said DCA is a proven strategy and can't suggest it more on major projects Iike BTC and ETH but having a variety of strategies at your disposal is invaluable especially when you have little capitol to work with.

After 3 years in this market, and after going through a long and hopeless bear market, **I promise you get used to the price going all over the place.** You just become numb to it.

Trading was never really my thing, I just bought and (mostly) held BTC and ETH throughout the following months and, eventually, years. I tried to trade a little bit at the beginning, but it just made me lose money. Like I said, it was a bear market, your didn't see your favorite shitcoin 15x overnight just because Walmart might collaborate with them in the future, you'd wake up with your portfolio dripping blood.

For those of you who haven't gone through a bear market yet, you guys should understand the downward trend isn't constant. Some days are up, some are down, most are sideways. I used to read articles from so-called ''crypto experts'' calling for golden triangles, golden arcs and golden dicks in the charts, pointing at shit that doesn't really make sense, but they sound confident so they must be right!

You believe them at first, you get your dose of hopium, you feel good, but you then realize pretty quickly they don't actually know what they're talking about and they're as clueless as you are lol.

A bear market isn't complete despair, you do get a little bit of hopium from time to time. You see your portfolio up 5% in a day and you're like ''THIS IS IT! THE BULL MARKET IS BACK!'' and then it dips 7% the next day. 

Or the market going sideways for months, everybody's waiting for something to happen. Suddenly there's a rumor something's big coming in a week or so. You don't know what will happen, but you're hoping for the moon.... and then it crashes another 35% for no apparent reason. 

Holding through a bear market is tough when you haven't gone through one, sometimes it does feel like you're throwing money out the window (I didn't think BTC would ever go back to 20k, let alone triple it at its peak), but the payoff is **incredibly** worth it. You knew the sentiment was ULTRA bullish when people spammed it's over 9000 memes (the OGs remember).

Anyway, this post doesn't really have a purpose, i'm legit just talking. I guess what i'm trying to say is that you might feel down right now, or anxious, or whatever negative emotion. You might be looking at your portfolio 24/7 with thoughts of quitting racing through your mind. 

I can't tell you if you should or not, crypto might be going to 0 in the long run, **nobody knows.** Just be happy that you were there for the ride. I know I am anyway.

My only advice is this: if you ever feel like predicting tomorrow's price, do the opposite of what your gut is telling you, or in other words, inverse what you think is the most logical play to *you*. You're usually wrong.

P-S: I barely look at the prices anymore, but I still wanna thank the people in this sub for letting me know if the market's up or down.

A couple months ago I looked into stable coins, and decided to buy some TCAD (I'm in Canada)  to get in on Earn through CDC. I figured TCAD is straight 1:1 so even thought it creates a taxable event when selling or trading, there's no gains or losses so no dings at tax time (please correct me if this is wrong). Anyway, things have been dipping nicely lately, and I wondered about pulling some TCAD to make some buys and remembered CDC has an exchange app that looks like a better spread than the standard app. I've avoided this completely thinking trades cause taxes but the more I think about it, does it really matter?

The underlying cause of those losses was an industry-wide breakdown of mortgage lending and securitization practices from around 2005 through 2007. The nature of that breakdown was not fully revealed until many years later through investigations by the US Department of Justice, which revealed the nature and extent of the problems in a series of major settlements starting in 2013.” (Journal of Structured Finance)

I entered crypto in 2017, and subsequently got snarled and bottom dragged with everyone else over the next few years, up through today where I, along with many of you, are still in healthy green profit. This is simply to say that, I have first hand felt the mental/financial impacts of a true bear market, and I am fully aware now that you need to be prepared for what's coming - this week or down the road.

While this is targeted for everyone here, this is probably more relevant for those of you that have life changing money tied up in crypto, and god forbid, especially for those of you that have invested more than you can afford to lose! 

One thing is for sure - there is a very real possibility that globally the financial shit blows up this week or next, which could potentially derail crypto down a dark, miserable path for the foreseeable future. My advice to you is to take stock of your own situation, needs, etc., and decide what you need to do in a worst case scenario.

Examples of things to consider/prepare for:

Taxes. Do you/will you have money on hand to pay your upcoming tax bill? Remember that, in the US at least, you will be paying capital gains taxes on any and all taxable events (i.e., all cumulative profits obtained when you sold any crypto holdings minus all losses) for the taxable year. There is no avoiding this. The IRS gives fuck all about how the value of your portfolio recently cratered and is currently sitting at -90%. The IRS only is concerned about collecting what you owe from the total profits that you made over the taxable year. IF you haven't done the calculations and set aside enough money to pay your upcoming tax bill, prepare to be in a world of hurt. The IRS are greedy bastards, and they regularly and quickly apply penalties and accruing interest on any unpaid balances and late payments! This can lead to liens, garnishment, and all sorts of nasty measures, so set aside cash and be prepared!

Upcoming financial obligations that must be met. For example: any loans, interest, anticipated personal/family expenditures, medical bills, down payments, etc. that you anticipate needing money for. Are you prepared to do without your money that is tied up and/or beat down to shit in a bear market over the next few years?

Other?

Ideas for preparation based around your specific financial needs (this is NOT financial advice. DYOR):

Consider selling a portion of your crypto soon (now?) while we’re still in the green. For me, I want to stay in for the long term, BUT, I’m prepared to sell just enough now to cover my upcoming needs. 


Begin to gradually DCA out now. This is a more forgiving schedule than outright selling larger chunks. Take some percentage of your profits, put aside for that rainy day as they accrue.
Modify your platform settings accordingly to allow you to make a move if you need to move quickly. For example, if you’re with Celsius Networks and you have HODL mode activated, just know that it takes a full 24 hours once you deactivate this mode - during which time you cannot do anything (i.e., make withdrawals, etc.)


Remember that any staked coins (like Ethereum 2.0, etc.) that are being held by third parties for a contracted period of time, cannot be touched! This means that you can’t factor the current value of the current coins into any immediate plans to put aside your rainy day funds, as you will NOT be able to sell them right now or possibly anytime soon.

TLDR summary: No one knows for sure what is going to happen as a result of the expected fallout from the China financial debacle, but the time to take stock of your own financial situation and what you might need financially to get through a protracted global financial crisis, is now.

**Background**

A few months ago the admins launched a [new L2 scaling network](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/opibci/were_launching_a_scaling_network_for_moons/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for Community Points built on Arbitrum technology. Moons that were held in the vault at the time of launch were automatically migrated to this new network, but any Moons held in external addresses were left on L1 (the Rinkeby Testnet). This L2 scaling network is currently being tested on top of the Rinkeby Testnet with the plan to eventually migrate to the Ethereum Mainnet, **although we do not know when this will occur.** The admins provided [the migration tool](https://new.reddit.com/web/points-migration) for users that held Moons outside the vault so they can migrate their Moons manually to the new L2 network.

**Necessity to Migrate**

The admins [have stated](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/opibci/were_launching_a_scaling_network_for_moons/h70le9m/) that Moons will need to be bridged to the new L2 network *before* the network is migrated to Mainnet, and currently we do not know when this will occur or how much notice will be provided to users. Users who haven’t already migrated are advised to do so ASAP. Recently the admins' holdings and the community fund have been migrated to L2 leaving \~6 million Moons yet to be migrated, with the majority of those tied up in the xmoon &lt;-&gt; L1 bridge.

**The Migration Tool**

In order to use the migration tool you will need Rinkeby ETH (rETH) to pay the transaction fees for the initial transfer. If you do not have any rETH please PM me your address and I will send enough for you to complete the migration.

If you have L1 Moons you can login to Reddit on desktop and navigate to [the migration tool,](https://new.reddit.com/web/points-migration) connect your MetaMask wallet (make sure you’re on the Rinkeby Test Network at the top, see photo below) and follow the prompts to migrate. You will need \~10-30 minutes to complete the process and the browser window cannot be closed so it is best to initiate when you have ample free time. In order to finalize your L2 ticket claims you will need to [add Reddit’s Arbitrum Testnet to MetaMask](https://np.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/owspo6/instructions_to_add_reddits_arbitrum_testnet_to/), for which the instructions will be displayed in the migration tool page.

&amp;#x200B;

If you attempt to claim L2 tickets and receive an error when setting the gas price to zero, try setting to 0.00000000000000001 gwei instead. Keep in mind the transaction will not go through if the gas limit is set under 21,000. If the issue persists please PM me your MetaMask address and I will send you a small amount of L2 rETH. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you have completed the migration you will be provided with your new vault balance as well as the txn hash for your newly delivered Moons:

&amp;#x200B;

**XMOON Holders**

Users holding xmoon will need to bridge from xmoon back to L1 Rinkeby Moons *before* utilizing the migration tool. Xmoon can be bridged using the herokuapp burner wallet with a small amount of xdai used to pay the transaction fee. If you need a small amount of xdai to bridge back to L1 please PM me your address.

So basically this is what I showed my parents...this is how our currency has performed against the US dollar this last year: (take into account it's a logarithmic scale to show porcentual changes)

As you can see the rate of return is not very good. Our currency is literally a shitcoin, losing value every single week (take into account the dollar also loses value). I really think our economy could use ICP as a currency and we would even be better off haha.

Anyways I wanted to share that. I can't stress the similarities enough (huge deficit, unsustainable debt) that have taken us to this point, but I also seem to see in the US, so buy assets that will safe guard you from inflation such as this.

I also wanted to mention that it's illegal to buy foreign currency (dollars) so stablecoins and BTC have had a great impact by allowing the average person to save.

Around 3-4 months ago I got interested in the idea of playing some blockchain based Pay to Earn (P2E) games due to my interest in the idea of NFTs in games and the potential for this idea. My interest was initially sparked by the initial rise of Axie Infinity and the idea that I could make some decent money if I played these games. Sadly, I did not have enough money to invest in Axie Infinity at the time (still don't!), and upon review of the gameplay &amp; the way the game works - had no interest in being a scholar or anything.

This lead me to look for free to play or low cost games to play, but most of the games with immediate decent return required quite significant investment (crypto blades, the aforementioned Axie) or were based purely on buying and selling NFTs, hoping they would grow in value.

# Gods Unchained

I actually first heard about Gods Unchained from a random comment in the daily discussion about 2.5 months ago. Someone had just asked a question about it and no one responded to them, so I decided to do my own research (DYOR) into this

**What is it?**

Simply put, it is a hearthstone clone (A digital card game) with some differences. But more on that in a moment!

It's built by Immutable X which is an NFT based marketplace built on the layer 2 of ETH to provide 0 gas fees when buying or trading NFTs on their marketplace. They are about to release their own token IMX, some of which has already been pegged to be dropped for Gods Unchained players and NFT owners on IMX.

*Brief timeline of events (*[*https://blog.godsunchained.com/2020/09/30/how-far-weve-come-the-timeline-of-gods-unchained/*](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2020/09/30/how-far-weve-come-the-timeline-of-gods-unchained/)*):*

The game was announced - **July 9th 2018**

Closed beta began - **November 11th 2018** 

Open beta began - **June 10th 2019**

Changed names from Fuel Games to Immutable - **August 6th 2019**

Genesis (first expansion/set for sale) set sale ends - **October 29th 2019**

Flux and fusing go live (more on flux &amp; fusing in **How does the P2E work?**) -  **February 20th 2020**

Trial of the gods launch (second expansion) - **Sept 10th 2020**

&amp;#x200B;

The game is still in Beta and still being worked on, but for the most part is a fully functioning game with tournaments, lots of players and cards to earn!

**Gameplay**

As I said previously, this game is a Hearthstone (HS) clone, or if we want to be less cynical: Heavily inspired by Hearthstone. So if you have ever played HS, Elder scroll legends or a similar game, you will be right at home here. For those of you who have never played Hearthstone or maybe only played other card games, I'll go over it in brief.

*The goal of the game is to take your opponents health from 30 to 0.* You can achieve this in many different ways, but the primary goal is to use creature cards to attack your opponent and kill them. There are also spell cards and relics (weapons) which can aid you in this goal.

There are 6 gods in the game and each have their own unique cards, creatures, and relics as well as being able to draw from the neutral set of cards. Each god also has god powers (more on this shortly)

Creature cards have 3 main stats, plus any supplemental text and keywords. The stats are Mana cost, Health and Attack. 

# 

[Very basic card with no card text showing Mana cost, Attack &amp; Health.](https://preview.redd.it/d4vbbf0n6xo71.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b70a35cd8914e4d67632043df84c96e25c22f96e)

Mana cost is how much ""mana"" it costs to play. Mana is unlocked 1 per turn and each player starts on 1 mana on turn 1. Turn 2 = 2 mana, turn 3 = 3 mana etc. Where this differs from Hearthstone is that once you get past turn 5, it takes more than 1 turn to unlock each subsequent mana unlock. See the picture below. It would take 12 turns to play an 8 mana card and you would not be able to play a 9 mana creature until **Turn 16**.

There are also ""small bags of tricks"" (NOT A CARD) - which give you one mana pip (basically The Coin in HS) for one turn only, allowing you to play a higher level card than you would be able to normally. The player going first gets 1 of these and the player going 2nd gets 3.

# 

[This shows some information on how the board is laid out and where the Bag of Tricks are located.](https://preview.redd.it/4usc3xur6xo71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c467853b62c7f48e68310436bb9b13467d36c63b)

Attack is how much damage your creature does every time it is used to attack an enemy and would take the corresponding amount from the enemy's health.

Health is how much damage it can take before dying and damage is permanent unless you have a spell which restores health. What I mean by permanent is that when cards or creatures ""hit"" each other they will use their attack against the opposing creature's health. Let's say our 1 attack, 3 health creature attacked a 2 attack, 1 health creature, our creature would live with 1 attack, and one health left - leaving it to fight another day.

Now there are other stats on creatures cards which come in the form of keywords (again similar to HS) which I'm not going to go into in this post but you can read about them [here](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2019/09/27/12-essential-card-mechanics/)

Spell cards are cards which do something when you cast them and cost a certain amount of mana - could be draw 2 cards, deal 5 damage to a creature, destroy a creature with the highest damage etc.

Relics (weapons from HS) are things your god can equip and they have many different functions, some can attack and your god will take damage as well as damage the enemy, some can heal you, some can summon minions when you cast spells, some can bring creatures back to life etc.

As I mentioned previously, you have a choice for each god of 3 god powers, each often leading to a different archetype of deck, so choose wisely!

# 

[The 3 options of god powers for the Light God. These get changed sometimes and you should expect them to possibly change in the future](https://preview.redd.it/jjapybje6xo71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f8070fed96a834b21cecc0458c89b3ab0b2006f)

The sanctum is something they added which draws on a resource in the game called ""favor"", once you earn enough favor you can buy cards from the sanctum to add to your hand. You receive favor by killing enemy creatures or attacking your opponents god directly. The sanctum is being changed and balanced quite regularly.

# 

[The cards shown are cards you can pull into your hand and cost X amount of favor to purchase. Favor is gained by attacking the enemy god or destroying minions.](https://preview.redd.it/bzqhner86xo71.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b023b206795c5687ac38204e1893af5002d14b)

There's plenty more to it and TONS of key words and niche cards, but if you're interested you can look into that yourself!

&amp;#x200B;

**In game ecosystem**

*This section will talk strictly about how easy/hard it is to earn packs &amp; new cards - the next section will go into selling cards for money.*

The game starts you off with a **Welcome Set** (70 cards x2, so 140 IIRC) which contains quite a few strong and decent cards, both neutral and god specific so you have something to begin with. On top of this you will earn card packs just through playing and leveling up (winning is NOT required to level up) which will earn you **Core** packs. These packs contain 5 core cards which everyone can earn and play (and buy if you want), each level will get you one rare pack (at least 1 rare card), every 10 levels will earn you an epic pack (at least 1 guaranteed epic), and every 25 levels will earn you a legendary pack (you guessed it, 1 guaranteed legendary card). There are over 250 core cards, so plenty to get!

Whenever you win games you will earn Stars &amp; Flux (more on flux later). Stars can be used to purchase cards directly from the in game marketplace (NOT IMX), but only specific ones they are offering at that time. I believe they have a daily, weekly, and 2 others (I'm not sure exactly what they are) but they are all core or Welcome Set from what I've seen.

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of what you can purchase with stars. Notice the different colours? Red = meteorite and can be sold on the block chain, Purple = Shadow and can also be sold, but is a level up from meteorite and therefore rarer. See the figure below for more info.](https://preview.redd.it/0pxupgf37xo71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08b49ab35c95fcfb57d0da412918f6efb73da4cd)

As you play more games you will rank up in their ranked system. These ranks honestly don't offer a lot of benefit to ranking up (as far as rewards go) unless you want to earn more cards in the weekend ranked event. The Weekend Ranked Event is the focus for a lot of the community as you can earn a LOT of packs during this time. Essentially you try to win as many games as you can within your first 25 games of the weekend (Fri-Sun) and depending on what rank you are in and how many wins you get - you win bonus packs! You can even win bonus packs for the next expansion before it's released. 

The top rank is Mythic and this is where the best players play so extra wins here count for more packs. It's honestly a really generous system if you can get a decent number of wins

You can read more here if you are interested: [https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/19/play-to-earn-with-weekend-ranked/](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/03/19/play-to-earn-with-weekend-ranked/)

&amp;#x200B;

**How does the P2E work?**

**DISCLAIMER: FORGE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED SO THE BELOW INFORMATION IS HOW IT WILL/SHOULD WORK ONCE IT REOPENS, SUBJECT TO ANY CHANGES OBVIOUSLY.**

This is an NFT based card game where you have the chance to own your collection and buy and sell new cards to other players. 

The basic premise of the Play to Earn system is that you can ""mint"" your cards into different qualities and these are rarer the higher up you go. Every card you earn through packs in game are all non minted cards and cannot be traded until you mint the cards through the forge. The forge uses flux and multiple duplicate cards to create higher quality cards, see the image below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Flux &amp; Plain cards are required to fuse in order to sell. Only Meteorite and higher cards can be sold and traded. This picture is fairly old so this may change!](https://preview.redd.it/ffgy2b81swo71.jpg?width=582&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b7d33eb8e427953f53e902b6ce5b36e1797ca45)

As mentioned in the Disclaimer above, the forge is currently closed with no exact end date, but the community does expect it to be open before the end of the year. It was closed since the fees were too high since they had not (and still haven't?) fully rolled out the layer 2 minting.

Another feature of this game is that the cards in expansions and original sets (not welcome/core) are limited in value and more will never be made. This had lead to some cards from the Genesis set being worth hundreds and even thousands for just the meteorite options. It also means that any card you mint is yours forever! There are also downsides to this (imo) which I'll touch on in the next section.

They are also planning on releasing a token specific to Gods Unchained (GODS) which hasn't fully been explained what it will do, but will have something to do with fusing and is probably going to be earned by playing/winning games. More here: [https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/07/13/glimpse-of-gods/](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2021/07/13/glimpse-of-gods/)

Honestly the basic premise of the P2E system is pretty simple and there isn't really a ton to speculate on while the forge is closed. Prices for the old sets are sky rocketing, and even prices for core cards (anyone can earn them) which were minted prior to the shut down are rushing up. I personally expect a pretty big dip in the prices of core cards especially once the forge reopens and people flood the market with their hoarded cards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is it fun?**

Honestly it is fun! It's one of the most polished &amp; fun blockchain games I've played and I would still play it even if I wasn't trying to make a bit of money from it. The big 8 and 9 mana creatures feel fucking amazing to play and are *really* strong some of the time, there is a lot of strategy and different deck types available (for the most part) to play which is fueled by the 3 different god powers for each god. Plus the sanctum can make the game more dynamic each time. And it's fun to get in ""early"" (been 3 years 🤣) on a card game before everything becomes a netdeck fest like Hearthstone.

There are problems though: The dev team seems to take forever to make balance changes, and when they do they seem VERY slow to revert them. 

Example: There is a current card called Enduring shield (core card), which without going into specifics is really broken and sucks to play against - completely flooding the meta (reminds me of pirate warrior from Hearthstone). The card was more defensive in nature previously until around 1 month ago when they changed it to more proactive and people are not happy. I understand making bold changes, but sometimes you have to admit you made a mistake and revert/fix the card. 

Part of me does not envy them in terms of balance because they only have a limited pool of cards they can buff or nerf. After an expansion they give themselves up to 90 days to balance/change these cards and once that time period runs out, they can NEVER change these cards again - leading to some really really strong cards that only older or rich players own. Luckily the price of these cards can be an obstacle to stop everyone owning it at least. This leads into my next point:

Some of the older cards (legendaries especially) have very specific text or effects which can't be replicated by free to play players, giving them an inherent advantage in certain matchups. And some of the old cards are just really OP for their stats and tend to be run in every deck.

*I know the previous two points are applicable to physical card games, but in my opinion they are losing the biggest strength that digital card games have*. *Plus it will piss people off immensely if they ban cards they have paid for.*

That's not to say you can't compete if you don't put money in! I'm not an expert or even a ""good"" player by any means but I've got to Mythic (highest rank) multiple times using F2P cards and I've probably put about $30 worth of ETH into buying some cheap cards. And I tend to do pretty OK on the weekend ranked to earn some extra packs.

One thing I hope they add in the future is a sealed mode or an option like HS' arena which would allow players to play on even footings without feeling like they are heavily behind because they got in late.

Overall I'd recommend it in terms of fun if you are looking for a new card game to play or are interesting in trying something new. It's very easy to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Community**

The community for this game is great, literally 10/10 - they are all SO friendly, welcoming and helpful. A lot of them stream &amp; do giveaways regularly and host tournaments with cards as rewards. I'm not going to link to their streams or anything as their are honestly too many great ones, but I will link the discord in a comment below.

I myself actually won a legendary on my first ever giveaway (yay!) and have not really won anything since 😭

&amp;#x200B;

**The future**

The new expansion ([Divine Order](https://godsunchained.com/expansions/divine-order)) will be releasing on September 27th which you can purchase with ETH through immutable if you'd like to do that, so that's something very exciting to look forward to!

As far as price &amp; making money goes? It's really hard to tell how the IMX &amp; GODS tokens will do for investments. I so forsee the IMX token doing well since it's trying to be an NFT marketplace for multiple games and assets whereas the GODS token is specifically for Gods Unchained. I'm definitely excited for the future of this game as it seems to be growing consistently!

Once the forge opens I hope that can propel future growth in players once they realize the potential that owning you own cards in a card game has.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**

* One of the few fun blockchain games out there
* You can own your own cards, so sell whenever you want!
* Very generous pack offerings
* Limited numbers of cards pushes up rarity
* Great marketplace with 0 fees (outside of initial ETH transfer, which is out of their hands)
* Excellent Community &amp; Devs are active in the community
* [Former MTG Arena Director Chris Clay is on the team](https://blog.godsunchained.com/2019/08/07/chris-clay-joins-gods-unchained-as-game-director/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons**

* They are slow to work on things - been in beta for nearly 3 years
* Forge has been closed a long time with no exact or project end date (just a roadmap)
* Balance is very hard to achieve due to nature of un-editable cards that are already minted on the blockchain, this means new cards are hard to balance around old ones and some old cards' power levels are way too high
* Lack of communication from the balance team about the state of different OP cards and the current status of the meta
* Quite a few bugs lately like cards staying on screen, not able to attack enemy god, quite a bit of disconnecting etc.
* Only has ranked mode - no sealed, arena, casual mode

&amp;#x200B;

**My personal rating**

As far as a blockchain games I'd give it **8/10** \- It still has room to improve but has a good foundation and I'm excited to see what the new expansion brings and the future of the game.

If you're comparing to ANY other card game, I'd downgrade it to a 6/10 because it doesn't quite have the same polish as hearthstone (no emotes, doesn't feel as good to attack, less animations etc). Could do with an arena/sealed mode as well. It doesn't really have its own mechanics that set it apart heavily like other cards games.

**Final words**

I enjoyed writing this and I know I may have been a little harsh in the cons/problems section with the game but I really do enjoy it and hopefully at least some of you will take the time to try it! It's definitely worth your time to check out, even if you don't stick with it :)

The Chinese exchanges will open at 9:30am their time, which equates to 9:30pm EST. You may see a huge dip then, which may or may not get worse as their trading day goes on. Smart investing says liquidate crypto first, as it cannot cover traditional payments. I personally expect to wake up to a shitshow tomorrow. 

If the company craps the bed and the CCP doesn't bail them out, there will be a snowball effect on other companies and more people will need more liquidity. This could see big dips in Crypto over the next week(s). 

Not sure what my move is yet. Wait for a bit, or if there is a big dip tomorrow, buy it incase there is a upward correction soon.

USD/INR: 73.73 

USDT/INR: 79.8  (USD has been stable for a while. It stays in the 73's for the most part) 

Now on to the stablecoins like USDT, USDC etc, they cost me 79.5-80 INR to buy at the moment (WazirX). Even on other multiple P2P platforms, this rate is mostly around and above 80. Which is around **10% more than USD/INR.** It goes upto 82-83 from what I have seen. And it fluctuates a lot more as well. It was 76 just a few days ago btw. It never goes down to the value of 1 USD though. Always above 75-76 INR ($1.02-$1.03). 

So I understand that the rate is being inflated due to high demand BUT isn't that what stablecoins are supposed to protect me from? If INR against USD was volatile, it'd be understandable because USDT is mirroring USD, but USD/INR is stable while USDT isn't. 

In comparison this also inflates the INR pairs for all coins. For eg, if I want to buy at 1 BTC @ $40k. According to USDINR- this would be 40k\*73.73=**2949200**

According to USDT/INR this would be 40k\*79.5= **3180000**

Do you see the insane difference (8%)? That's how these prices are portrayed in INR as well. It doesn't use USD/INR to convert the rates but USDT instead. 

Why is a stablecoin so volatile just because it's INR? Is there any way this could be changed? Aren't they supposed to make more coins according to demand to keep the price equal to 1$?

Crypto prices have been decreasing significantly lately and many people on this subreddit urge to buy the dip. I disagree. I believe sticking to your DCA plan is far superior. I could explain why but the following article does a way better job: [https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-buying-the-dip-is-a-terrible-investment-strategy/](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-buying-the-dip-is-a-terrible-investment-strategy/) Check it out!

TLDR; Buying the dip is unlikely to outperform DCA with regards to a long-term appreciating asset. When it does, the outperformance is limited at best. When it does not, the underperformance is rather significant.

Blockchain is a distributed public ledger that records cryptocurrencies transactions.

In the last 10 years or so, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology has overcome all blockades in its way, destroying all kinds of myths and cynicism. Passionate followers have not only adopted these digital currencies but they have been fast enough to update themselves with this ever changing technology.

Therefore, in this fast changing world it would be worth knowing, how to store and secure your precious Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies using digital wallets.

# What is a Digital Wallet?

Similar to fiat currencies, digital currencies need to be managed and stored somewhere. As we keep dollar bills securely in a wallet so do we need to store our digital currencies like Bitcoin in wallets.

A digital wallet refers to a smart electronic device or a software program that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online. This can include sending-receiving digital currencies or purchasing items with a computer, tablet, smartphone or any other smart device. A digital wallet uses software for proving authenticity of device/user, based on information stored in device itself. So a digital wallet has both a software and information component inside it. The software in combination with information like password, pin or a master key provides required minimal security and encryption for online transactions. There are two types of digital wallets available in the market: One is operated at client side or user side, where private keys are stored on user device itself. Another type of digital wallet can be maintained at server side and private keys are usually stored on the service provider server or exchange. The latter one is slightly easier to operate for end user as most of the setup hassle is handled by the exchange. Let us explore these digital wallets further.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cool relevant photo I found](https://preview.redd.it/bz0501z85xo71.png?width=2310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=851e68269ee4e5a5f525f994e7fd00c58c4b482f)

# Crypto Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins, basically, a master key (private key to be more specific). These are special digital wallets used to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin etc and sometimes also called as Crypto Wallets. Like normal wallets, one can add, send or receive digital currencies from crypto wallets using private keys. These private keys/master keys are generated using strong cryptographic algorithms. This master key is used to authenticate a device/person identity to a wallet system. Once user identity is verified only then can someone make crypto transactions. Usually private keys are made up of alphanumeric strings of different lengths. A cryptocurrency wallet stores public and private key combination, which can be used to buy or send the cryptocurrency from your address to new address. A wallet can contain multiple pairs of public and private keys.

# How Does it Actually Work?

Cryptocurrency transactions work much like a traditional banking system and needs to trust on third party service providers usually a cryptocurrency exchange or a miner, in case you are not running a full node. This third party exchange/miner keeps record of all cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain, acting as a fully functional digital ledger. These service providers have huge computation power and charge a nominal fee for operational cost coverage.

Unlike banking systems these crypto systems are decentralized and all work in a democratic way, by majority agreement. Service providers usually link the individual wallet to their core wallet. So just like with a bank for debit or credit card, the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Even though crypto wallets are extremely safe, sometimes due to poor management of private keys by exchanges, hackers can trick system to steal user’s cryptocurrencies. This happened in the case of Mt. Gox exchange hacking in Japan, where exchange lost most of their clients’ bitcoins in a single hack incident.

Similar to how bank allocates a unique savings account number to a user, crypto exchanges assign a unique Digital Address (an alphanumeric string) and a unique Private Key to a user. This crypto address is just like your bank account number and can be shared publicly without any concerns of hacking. Only a person having access to private key of a digital address can view and operate transactions from that account. Private key is used for authentication during sending and receiving bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. On the other hand, access to the receiving wallet is not required for sending any cryptocurrency. Sender only needs to know the destination address and anyone can send cryptocurrency to that address.

If the private key of a crypto wallet is not compromised/leaked then it is almost impossible to break into your digital account. Its a well known fact that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA, has the highest computational power on earth. It is mathematically calculated that if all of NSA computational power is used even then it may take years to break into your digital account with brute force hacking method. These systems are so secure that if you forgot or lose the secret private key for your account then your bitcoins and cryptos are lost forever.

At present, there are four varieties of cryptocurrecy wallets widely in use.

# Web Wallet:

A web wallet is a web based service that allows users to store and control their private keys and other useful information at a service provider server. All crypto transactions are performed by using any standard web browser like Google Chrome. While using a web wallet user private keys are managed by a third party provider. Due to several Bitcoin and other crypto hacking incidents several exchanges have started providing two-factor-authentication (2FA) feature to their customers.

A common example of a web wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW). One can further visit [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) to know more about how this web wallet works. The most important thing to remember is, user should always make sure whether they are using the right URL/website and if the entire communication from your browser to server is encrypted using “https” protocol. If a website is not starting with https, always avoid it to create any accounts or send and receive any crypto currencies.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost.  
No need to carry an extra device while you are travelling or outside home.

**Cons:**  
Unsafe as hackers and keyloggers can hack your account and steal your funds.  
Difficult to transact on a public wifi.

&amp;#x200B;

How Bitcoin exchanges and wallet works

# Software Wallet:

A software wallet is like any desktop application installed locally on your computer, or a mobile app installed on your Android or iOS based smart devices. For example, ImToken Mobile Wallet app is installed and used as we use any other app from Google Play or iPhone App stores. IMtoken is among the best software wallets with ample features supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. However, all software wallets might have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be used by hackers to perform illegal transactions from your digital wallet. With software wallet you have the option of using the same private key for your software wallet as well as web wallet. But for all cases securing your private key is utmost important.  
IMtoken is downloadable on both Android and iOS.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost as most apps are freely available.  
Much more secure than Web Wallet.

**Cons:**  
Require regular software updates with product version releases.  
For security reasons a user needs to remove all data related to app when changing or selling the device.

# Paper Wallet:

Paper wallets are yet another kind of wallets used for cryptocurrencies management. Individuals can print their digital addresses and private keys in the form of a QR code on a piece of paper. This piece of paper acts as a physical wallet and should be always kept at a safe place. Actually, it provides pretty good security as private key is stored offline and not vulnerable to hacking. However, this advantage is only applicable till private key is on paper. Once you enter the private key in a wallet to operate your transaction then it is equally vulnerable as is your underlying OS and software. Infact, there is additional hassle of entering private key again and again. Although one can use barcode reader but that again leaves a loophole in the safe operation of private key.

**Pros:**  
Easy to store and can be kept in a cupboard or a physical safe.  
Since it is stored offline its always protected from hackers.  
Its portable as it is much easy to carry paper and can be kept in a normal fiat wallet.

**Cons:**  
Can be easily destroyed intentionally or unintentionally.

# Hardware Wallet:

These days our computers and smart devices are always connected with internet. Each device usually have multiple apps, web browsers and softwares. These web browsers and apps can have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited by a seasoned hacker. Moreover, it was found from a survey that end users tend to ignore regular software updates, posing great risk to their device and investments. Its a possibility that private keys on an internet connected device are compromised. These are some of the loopholes exploited by hackers during several Bitcoin and other high value cryptocurrencies hacks.

Hardware wallet is the best existing solution to all of these hacking concerns, as user private key is never shared with anyone and never leaves the hardware device. When a hardware wallet performs a transaction, wallet’s software creates an encrypted value from the private key. This encrypted value is then shared with the remote device (or exchange) to complete authentication of the transaction. This way hardware wallet provides the best security among all digital wallets.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the best hardware wallet companies with a variety of products with different safety features. Both companies have created devices that require user to physically enter a pin by pressing button on the device to finally trigger the transaction. Some hardware wallets also have addition layer of security where user is required to enter a secret pin to open the hardware wallet. All these new safety devices and features have forced hackers to burn more midnight oil. If a user is taking all precautions then it is almost impossible to hack such devices by anyone.

**Pros:**  
Extremely secure as private keys are never exposed.  
Since it is a stand alone, separate device chances of virus infection are minimal.  
Devices have additional layer of security possible like pressing a button or pin entry.  
You can do transactions safely even on public wifi networks.  
Can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies.

**Cons:**  
Usually hardware wallets are expensive. A good hardware wallet can easily cost $100 plus.  
Device should always be with you to make any transaction.

Under this new protocol, fungible digital assets are deposited into a Revest smart contract in exchange for their non-fungible representation. The digital assets underlying the FNFT will remain locked in the smart contract until specific criteria spelled out in the contract by the FNFT’s creator have been met. This criteria could be a time lock, a value lock, or a customizable address lock. Ownership of the FNFT itself may be freely transferred at any point prior to the smart contract’s maturity date, without affecting the market value of its underlying fungible tokens. The FNFT may be bought, sold, and traded on any platform which supports the ERC-1155 standard.

There are many potential applications for this new FNFT protocol. The digital assets locked into the FNFT may be subject to a variety of vesting and dispersal restrictions associated with the introduction of new tokens. Typical vesting schemes prohibit the trading of any assets during their vesting period; to facilitate a wider range of trading options, the Revest protocol allows for trading of unvested assets without contravening vesting restrictions or affecting the market value of the assets, as only an NFT representing the future ownership of the unvested asset is transferred.

Assets underlying the FNFTs may be forcefully locked to avoid spending prior to price increases or the passage of time. This mechanic may be used for anything from savings accounts, where additional assets may be deposited but not withdrawn, to inheritances, where the beneficiaries may be entrusted with assets that will not become available until many years into the future. Implementation of various DeFi standards allows for FNFTs to accrue interest over time, either collected into the underlying value of the FNFT itself, or deposited into the FNFT 2 holder’s wallet.

Here is the reality of this situation. Evergrande has issued 300$ bn in junk debt to the emerging markets divisions of major western banks. 

Key words there are “emerging markets divisions”. 

Unlike in 2008, this debt is not the bedrock of these institution’s balance sheets. They assume that there is a level of risk with this debt, which is why they have much more stable investments outside of China. 

Worst case scenario is western institutions selling off other investments to pay off their own debt, which was relying on the interest payments expected from Evergrande. However, it is extremely unlikely that western institutions are completely reliant, or even significantly reliant, on these debt payments to make their own obligations whole. 

Therefore, I do not believe there will be any mass selloff of anything as a chain reaction to this outside of China, and I definitely don’t think this means that major institutions who own crypto will be selling that crypto in any significant way.

Lawyer Eduardo Escobar of Citizen’s Action, a civic group devoted to government accountability, said Bukele’s strange profile description “is part of the president’s strategy,” noting “He is trying to ridicule the feelings of the public or the opposition.”  

The populist president elected in 2019 has maintained high popularity with his vows to stamp out corruption that was rampant among the country’s traditional parties. But some Salvadorans say he is becoming a dictator for real.

Bukele often uses Twitter to write about Bitcoin. The price and potential of the cryptocurrency appears to fascinate Bukele, and he made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, the first country to do so.

Some marchers last week protested the controversial decision by Bukele’s government to roll out a digital bitcoin wallet known as the “Chivo” one week ago. The system has been down frequently for maintenance.

The digital wallet appears to have been overloaded by the sheer number of Salvadorans looking to take advantage of the $30 bonus that the government put in each account to incentivize adoption.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3489640,public,self,El Salvador president says he's world's 'coolest dictator',0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psr2fr/el_salvador_president_says_hes_worlds_coolest/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get that BTC is a safe investment and a good hedge against potential losses, but BTC isn't gaining as much as some Altcoins do. Furthermore Bitcoin is controlling the entire crypto market simply by just moving up and down. 

So why don't we use the power of Bitcoin to our advantage?

What I am trying to say is, why don't we see Altcoins as some sort of synthetic Bitcoin, that replicate the movement of BTC but with higher potential gains?  If BTC goes up 5%, Altcoins tend to gain more. If BTC dumps, Altcoins dump further. At the end of the day the whole crypto market has been steadily on an uptrend for years now and every Cryptocurrency has followed Bitcoin so far.

I don't care if in the short term my portfolio is down, when in the long term Altcoins will be up more than Bitcoin does. Aside from that, there are many other Coins and Tokens that are also safe investments. 

I am thinking of swapping more of my BTC for some Altcoin because of the previous arguments, but I know that everything has it's drawbacks, so I'm asking you for your opinion on that matter.

Obviously, the safest thing you can ever do with your crypto is buy it, transfer it to a cold storage wallet that's not connected to anything, and bury it in a safe. Then just hold it for years. But when you do that, the only passive income you make is the increase (or decrease) in the value of your crypto.

Some wallets, some exchanges, and some lending platforms pay you interest if you stick your crypto there. For example, Coinbase pays you staking rewards on ATOM, XTZ, and ALGO (though most native ALGO wallets pay you more). Celsius and BlockFi are well known interest-paying platforms that pay you 4-6%ish interest on your BTC, other amounts on other coins, etc. These aren't completely safe, obviously, but they're big and established.

But then comes the DeFi options. If you want to stick your crypto into a liquidity pool, you can (allegedly) make some insane APYs. A basic option in this sector is Anchor Protocol (on the Terra network). You can stick UST into an interest-bearing account with them and make about 20% APY. If you're really daring, you can stick your UST and some ANC tokens in a UST-ANC liquidity pool, which pays you about 80% APY (in ANC tokens), which you can turn around and sell. Holy crap! 80% APY? Mirror Protocol does something similar with liquidity pools for a lot of synthetic stock assets.

Then there's protocols on top of protocols. Spectrum Protocol lets you stake in the Anchor Protocol liquidity pool through them, and they'll auto-compound your rewards for you every hour and re-stake them, raising the APY to about 120%, plus they pay you another 20% in spectrum tokens for a total APY of 140%? Holy crap! And then, they have their own spectrum token-UST liquidity pool to help provide liquidity when people sell their spectrum tokens that pays 290% APY? Double holy crap?

At this point, it all sounds a little crazy. If you're a middle class guy and you drop 100k into a 290% liquidity pool, do you really make almost $700 PER DAY in yields? Surely there's some insane risk or insane catch there. And even if you opted for one of the more reasonable 80% or 20% options, that's still 200/day or 50/day, respectively.

We get a type of S shape curve, with almost every technology.  It took half a century for electricity to be widely adopted in the US, a quarter of a century for half the population to get TVs, but mobile phone adoption took only half that time. 

Now let's compare one of the fastest adopted technologies of all time, The Internet adoption rate vs Bitcoin price. But before that, you must know that as of January 2021 there were 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide - **59.5 percent** of the global population. Of this total, 92.6 percent (4.32 billion) accessed the internet via mobile devices.

A fun fact, computers and internet goes back to 1,960. A computer cost was 700,000 usd (4,6m on todays price). And the first message ever sent was the word “lo;” the researchers were trying to type the word “login” and the system crashed after two letters. Crypto will have his errors, bugs, trial and dumps, but this is expected on a new technology.

[Internet adoption vs Bitcoin price.](https://preview.redd.it/m6567fd0owo71.png?width=1501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffaa795aa6bb8073f2abac5b4a4d34f720b7a8e9)

According to this graph, we are yet to see, the real price of BTC, and it is quite accurate on the price point we're seeing today. 

What about the offline people, those who have never used the internet before?

[US offline population.](https://preview.redd.it/ont7ve40qwo71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bec34a70b6c32236a70d22862f780f29dd1c643f)

On the US there's only 7% of people that have never ever used the internet. That's a little bit mindblowing for me, at this day and age.

Now, let's see how it's BTC beating the adoption speed of the Internet, and not according to me, but from Michael Levin, a former Google employee.

&amp;#x200B;

[Internet vs BTC adoption, via Michael Levin.](https://preview.redd.it/hugi9ltnqwo71.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca97566f588ff86eb397f76d104f1a6483a3e6ac)

""In only 12 years, Levin estimates that BTC reached 135 million users today with projections to have 1 billion users by 2025. It’s possible to distinguish that when the Internet was at the same point in its adoption curve, it took 7.5 years to reach 1 billion users. BTC will do the same in almost half the time. And can you imagine that, BTC reaching a 1 billion users? That would be huge for the entire ecosystem"". 

Now, what about the new adresses, and the creation of wallets.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Bitcoin network growth.](https://preview.redd.it/shitxaijtwo71.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb29e436ce14cb797907a6005ceef3a91da45b4)

We had a massive peak on 2017-2018, that was when we had a massive dump, and also one of the biggest if not the biggest bull run of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin goes Omnipresent.](https://preview.redd.it/5myu5dcirwo71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1dab17e5ebadb281acf1d38acde13a3e202f621)

Now I know, that sounds like a God (Omnipresent), but let's face it, based on all the facts, and a little bit of speculation, we can see that Bitcoin and the whole crypto community will take a huge adoption speed rate, and we're seeing it right now, most of all this present year, with even countries like El Salvador, making bitcoin part of the entire financial system.

I'm not worried about a dip, a red day, or anything like that. I believe on this new technology, and the present power that it has to change the world. 

Anyhow, hope this post was helpful, and made you get a better perspective on the entire ecosystem.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3489570,public,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qtYsiviGyXRco7xCCuJi5l_MmEupV5-pOZHEJHMqeYI.jpg,Reasons on why we're still

My question relates to the future of the BTC network. So for example, I've read that when the Ethereum network gets super busy it increases transaction costs which causes slower transaction times and congestion on the network. From my understanding, BTC aims to create a block roughly every 10 minutes but if everyone on Earth suddenly wanted to start transacting in BTC could it still maintain the 10 min confirmation times?  

What happens when the BTC network becomes too congested? Would it become a game of whose willing to pay the most in fees (like eth) to get their transaction through or is it more like everyone is stuck in line at the DMV and you just gotta take a number? I've heard about the lightning network which aims to remedy some of these issues but I've also heard it's not the end all solution some claim it to be due to various issues including the difficulty of setting it up.

In the bearmarket the price will go much lower then these dips. This is a legit question, im am kind of new in crypto an i have been checking the charts of the previous bearmarkets and they dropped really low. So it seems much more profitable to save up for a bearmarket.

Ofcourse i understand that if you plan to sell before the top of the bullmarket and then buy back in when the bearmarket is here, then its smart to buy dips.

I had suffered from  FOMO and all, invested in a  fare share of  shit coins that went no where like most of us. But still keep the solid projects. I may have entered some of them at ATH i still don't care. Why? Because crypto is still new back them it wasn't even crawling, started to crawl in 18, now is walking in 21, the best is yet to come, crypto is going to run and then is going to fly high... and i want to be part of it.

Nothing wrong with selling to take profits or to reenter later or just to protect your investment, o ly you know your level of risk and damage tolerance...while 5k or 10k is nothing for some, it  is a lot for most...

Aside from being extremely annoying, this is a great reminder of why the concept of proof of work was created in the first place. Adam Back, creator of Hash Cash, and the possible identity of Satoshi himself, mentioned in a number of interviews about the origins of bitcoin, that he created hash cash (and its proof of work system) as a way to stop spammers from ruining email groups.

How does it work? To be able to send an email, the sender's computer has to do a ton of unfakeable (energetic and computational) work to resolve a cryptographic puzzle. Once having completed the work, the sender acquires a token attach to the email that shows the proof of work. Said token elevates the cost of sending such that spamming becomes energetically (financially) intensive, and thus prohibitive. As a result, the community using the email group is protected from attacks against the integrity of their channel. It becomes very expensive for cheesy 'noise' to attack the precious 'signal' of the thread. One example of the so-called 'defender's advantage' in applied cryptography.

Later Backamoto used the same concept, but stacked additional networking, tokenomic, game theory elements on top of it to create bitcoin mining, which also resolves the famous double spend problem.

That's a non-expert lay person summarizing, so i'm sure there are some details I'm missing. However I think it's a good story to keep in mind, and to understand why proof of work exists in the furst place. It is energetically expensive on purpose so that you can't easily spam a precious resource.

The network can track this data and enter it directly into a smart contract. The smart contract can be set up to implement fines or issue warnings to these facilities and also alerts will be issued to cities exposed to potential pollution due to corporate misuse, Working to find alternatives to non-renewable energy with the same efficiency.

Its been time, I had read about a new cyptocurrency named **Pi**. 

**Pi** is a new digital currency and they claim to be The First Digital Currency You Can Mine On Your Phone. They enable this using a light, free, energy-light mobile app.

The main idea behind PI is to make it a currency of the common man. Hence they plan to launch after reaching 100 million users unlike Bitcoin which launched after having 18 million coins mined.

So Guys, I was just curious,

**Have you heard about this new emerging cryptocurrency named PI?**

# What is a Digital Wallet?

Similar to fiat currencies, digital currencies need to be managed and stored somewhere. As we keep dollar bills securely in a wallet so do we need to store our digital currencies like Bitcoin in wallets.

A digital wallet refers to a smart electronic device or a software program that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online. This can include sending-receiving digital currencies or purchasing items with a computer, tablet, smartphone or any other smart device. A digital wallet uses software for proving authenticity of device/user, based on information stored in device itself. So a digital wallet has both a software and information component inside it. The software in combination with information like password, pin or a master key provides required minimal security and encryption for online transactions. There are two types of digital wallets available in the market: One is operated at client side or user side, where private keys are stored on user device itself. Another type of digital wallet can be maintained at server side and private keys are usually stored on the service provider server or exchange. The latter one is slightly easier to operate for end user as most of the setup hassle is handled by the exchange. Let us explore these digital wallets further.

# Crypto Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins, basically, a master key (private key to be more specific). These are special digital wallets used to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin etc and sometimes also called as Crypto Wallets. Like normal wallets, one can add, send or receive digital currencies from crypto wallets using private keys. These private keys/master keys are generated using strong cryptographic algorithms. This master key is used to authenticate a device/person identity to a wallet system. Once user identity is verified only then can someone make crypto transactions. Usually private keys are made up of alphanumeric strings of different lengths. A cryptocurrency wallet stores public and private key combination, which can be used to buy or send the cryptocurrency from your address to new address. A wallet can contain multiple pairs of public and private keys.

# How Does it Actually Work?

Cryptocurrency transactions work much like a traditional banking system and needs to trust on third party service providers usually a cryptocurrency exchange or a miner, in case you are not running a full node. This third party exchange/miner keeps record of all cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain, acting as a fully functional digital ledger. These service providers have huge computation power and charge a nominal fee for operational cost coverage.

Unlike banking systems these crypto systems are decentralized and all work in a democratic way, by majority agreement. Service providers usually link the individual wallet to their core wallet. So just like with a bank for debit or credit card, the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Even though crypto wallets are extremely safe, sometimes due to poor management of private keys by exchanges, hackers can trick system to steal user’s cryptocurrencies. This happened in the case of Mt. Gox exchange hacking in Japan, where exchange lost most of their clients’ bitcoins in a single hack incident.

Similar to how bank allocates a unique savings account number to a user, crypto exchanges assign a unique Digital Address (an alphanumeric string) and a unique Private Key to a user. This crypto address is just like your bank account number and can be shared publicly without any concerns of hacking. Only a person having access to private key of a digital address can view and operate transactions from that account. Private key is used for authentication during sending and receiving bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. On the other hand, access to the receiving wallet is not required for sending any cryptocurrency. Sender only needs to know the destination address and anyone can send cryptocurrency to that address.

If the private key of a crypto wallet is not compromised/leaked then it is almost impossible to break into your digital account. Its a well known fact that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA, has the highest computational power on earth. It is mathematically calculated that if all of NSA computational power is used even then it may take years to break into your digital account with brute force hacking method. These systems are so secure that if you forgot or lose the secret private key for your account then your bitcoins and cryptos are lost forever.

At present, there are four varieties of cryptocurrecy wallets widely in use.

# Web Wallet:

A web wallet is a web based service that allows users to store and control their private keys and other useful information at a service provider server. All crypto transactions are performed by using any standard web browser like Google Chrome. While using a web wallet user private keys are managed by a third party provider. Due to several Bitcoin and other crypto hacking incidents several exchanges have started providing two-factor-authentication (2FA) feature to their customers.

A common example of a web wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW). One can further visit [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) to know more about how this web wallet works. The most important thing to remember is, user should always make sure whether they are using the right URL/website and if the entire communication from your browser to server is encrypted using “https” protocol. If a website is not starting with https, always avoid it to create any accounts or send and receive any crypto currencies.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost.  
No need to carry an extra device while you are travelling or outside home.

**Cons:**  
Unsafe as hackers and keyloggers can hack your account and steal your funds.  
Difficult to transact on a public wifi.

How Bitcoin exchanges and wallet works

# Software Wallet:

A software wallet is like any desktop application installed locally on your computer, or a mobile app installed on your Android or iOS based smart devices. For example, ImToken Mobile Wallet app is installed and used as we use any other app from Google Play or iPhone App stores. IMtoken is among the best software wallets with ample features supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. However, all software wallets might have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be used by hackers to perform illegal transactions from your digital wallet. With software wallet you have the option of using the same private key for your software wallet as well as web wallet. But for all cases securing your private key is utmost important.  
IMtoken is downloadable on both Android and iOS.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost as most apps are freely available.  
Much more secure than Web Wallet.

**Cons:**  
Require regular software updates with product version releases.  
For security reasons a user needs to remove all data related to app when changing or selling the device.

# Paper Wallet:

Paper wallets are yet another kind of wallets used for cryptocurrencies management. Individuals can print their digital addresses and private keys in the form of a QR code on a piece of paper. This piece of paper acts as a physical wallet and should be always kept at a safe place. Actually, it provides pretty good security as private key is stored offline and not vulnerable to hacking. However, this advantage is only applicable till private key is on paper. Once you enter the private key in a wallet to operate your transaction then it is equally vulnerable as is your underlying OS and software. Infact, there is additional hassle of entering private key again and again. Although one can use barcode reader but that again leaves a loophole in the safe operation of private key.

**Pros:**  
Easy to store and can be kept in a cupboard or a physical safe.  
Since it is stored offline its always protected from hackers.  
Its portable as it is much easy to carry paper and can be kept in a normal fiat wallet.

**Cons:**  
Can be easily destroyed intentionally or unintentionally.

# Hardware Wallet:

These days our computers and smart devices are always connected with internet. Each device usually have multiple apps, web browsers and softwares. These web browsers and apps can have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited by a seasoned hacker. Moreover, it was found from a survey that end users tend to ignore regular software updates, posing great risk to their device and investments. Its a possibility that private keys on an internet connected device are compromised. These are some of the loopholes exploited by hackers during several Bitcoin and other high value cryptocurrencies hacks.

Hardware wallet is the best existing solution to all of these hacking concerns, as user private key is never shared with anyone and never leaves the hardware device. When a hardware wallet performs a transaction, wallet’s software creates an encrypted value from the private key. This encrypted value is then shared with the remote device (or exchange) to complete authentication of the transaction. This way hardware wallet provides the best security among all digital wallets.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the best hardware wallet companies with a variety of products with different safety features. Both companies have created devices that require user to physically enter a pin by pressing button on the device to finally trigger the transaction. Some hardware wallets also have addition layer of security where user is required to enter a secret pin to open the hardware wallet. All these new safety devices and features have forced hackers to burn more midnight oil. If a user is taking all precautions then it is almost impossible to hack such devices by anyone.

**Pros:**  
Extremely secure as private keys are never exposed.  
Since it is a stand alone, separate device chances of virus infection are minimal.  
Devices have additional layer of security possible like pressing a button or pin entry.  
You can do transactions safely even on public wifi networks.  
Can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies.

**Cons:**  
Usually hardware wallets are expensive. A good hardware wallet can easily cost $100 plus.  
Device should always be with you to make any transaction.

**OpenSea’s Head of Product Out After Insider Trading**

This week, [OpenSea’s](https://opensea.io/) Head of Product has left the company on news that he has been trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on insider knowledge of when the company will be promoting individual works.  OpenSea is the world’s largest exchange for NFTs, which have seen explosive growth in demand and valuations over the last few months.  In August, OpenSea had two million transactions and $3.4 billion in trade volume.

OpenSea features a constantly changing rotation of NFTs on their homepage.  The allegation is that Nate Chastain, OpenSea’s Head of Product, was buying these NFTs before they were featured in expectation that they would appreciate in value.  These exchanges were found by a twitter user, [ZuwuTV](https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584).  Multiple Ethereum wallets were observed buying NFTs just before they were listed on OpenSea’s homepage; these were subsequently sold for a profit, which was then transferred to Chastain’s main wallet.  Just a few days after the tweet by ZuwuTV, OpenSea announced that “ . . . yesterday, we requested and accepted his resignation.”

This debacle was poorly timed for the company as it overshadowed the [launch](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-opensea-mobile-app/) of their mobile app.  OpenSea is funded by well known venture capitalists like Coinbase Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Mark Cuban, and more.  Their recent funding round pushed the valuation of the company over the $1 billion mark.

**Solana Outage Slows Growth and Demonstrates Project's Centralization**

On September 14, the [Solana network](https://status.solana.com/) went down for over 17 hours. During the outage, Coinbase, Binance, and other exchanges suspended trading of SOL, locking up over $10 billion. [Solana (SOL)](https://solana.com/) ([$47 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/) market cap) had recently tripled in market cap, but in the days following this outage Solana lost over 20% of its value and has been slow to rebound.

Crypto projects can ""go public"" through an initial DEX offering (IDO), which is like an initial coin offering (ICO) but on a decentralized exchange (DEX).

[According to Solana](https://nitter.net/aeyakovenko/status/1437795827704029189), the outage was caused by bots flooding the Solana network during an IDO on [Raydium (RAY)](https://raydium.io/). These bots performed 300,000 transactions per second, which Solana could not handle. Apparently, a fix for this issue was already under development.

When the network was overloaded, Solana's engineers couldn't fix the issue using the current software release, so Solana upgraded and restarted the network.

Crypto engineers and investors tend to dislike projects with centralized control, but engineers continue to choose Solana due to its extremely fast transactions and low fees. This outage calls into question the reliability of Solana and all the projects built on it. Solana [claims](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1438294812378243075?s=20) it will perform a thorough investigation of the outage and prevent similar issues in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

**Just How Much Adoption Are We Seeing?**

Over the past year, we’ve seen a deluge of stories about companies and countries adopting cryptocurrencies, but is it reasonable to really say we’re seeing “adoption”? Last month, the crypto analytics firm Chainalysis [published a report](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index) ranking adoption by country, reporting that we’ve seen a global adoption leap of 880% when compared to the previous year.

From their report, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan are leading the way.  In fact, most of the top-20 are composed of countries with emerging economies, including many that have introduced legislation to handle the growth of cryptocurrencies.  Chainalysis attributes much of the emerging market growth to peer-to-peer platform use.  This is the most common on-ramp to cryptocurrency for individuals in these countries, largely because they often have minimal access to centralized exchanges that are available in the developed world.  The primary uses of crypto in this case are to combat inflation in their local currency, to send and receive remittances without being subject to large fees, and to use crypto as a means of exchange.

Some noteworthy countries in the top-20 are Nigeria, where [1 in 3 people](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/crypto/) use cryptocurrency;  Brazil, where trading volume is [up 2,247%](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/crypto/) in the past year;  Venezuela, which has seen hyperinflation of over 2,000% annually; and Afghanistan (21st on the list), which has recently seen tremendous economic uncertainty as a result of Taliban rule.  Also listed within the top-20 were the US, China, Russia, and Brazil.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Supply Chain is Using the Blockchain**
International corporations are turning to blockchain solutions to manage their supply chains. Supply chain blockchain solutions offer solutions for tracking and authenticating materials through each stage of the supply chain, as well as payments.

Blockchain payment solutions can increase efficiency in the supply chain by triggering automatic payments from customer to vendor in particular situations, such as with delivery of a specific item.

Tracking and authentication solutions on the blockchain intend to help companies prove a product or material is authentic. Many supply chain cryptos also help companies track their materials through each stage in the supply chain. This tracking data also aids in product recall accuracy and environmental impact tracking and reporting.

**Major Projects:**

[Ethereum (ETH)](https://ethereum.org/en/) ([$393 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) market cap) - Ethereum’s ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard allows for tracking everything in a supply chain efficiently. ERC-721 was [used by Coca-Cola](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/cokes-bottlers-to-test-ethereum-for-supply-chain-management/) for a bottling supply chain test.

[VeChain (VET)](https://www.vechain.org/) ([$7 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vechain/) market cap) - Crypto project designed with supply chain management as a core functionality that has developed partnerships with major corporations in China and worldwide. VeChain allows companies to track materials throughout the supply chain in real time using real-world sensors and scannable QR codes.

[IOTA (MIOTA)](https://www.iota.org/) ([$4.3 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/) market cap) Private blockchain solution intended for enterprise customers with trade secrets and proprietary data. IOTA has established partnerships in agriculture and fashion.

Several smaller projects that focus on specialty business solutions have also gained traction:

[OriginTrail (TRAC)](https://origintrail.io/) ([$182 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/origintrail/) market cap) - a data exchange protocol for interconnected supply chains that recently doubled in market cap

[Waltonchain (WTC)](https://www.waltonchain.org/#/en) ([$89 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/waltonchain/) market cap) - an internet of things (IoT) focused blockchain for supply chain management

[Ambrosus (AMB)](https://ambrosus.io/) ([$21 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amber/) market cap) - a blockchain specifically for supply chain management in the agriculture and pharmaceutical sectors

&amp;nbsp;

**Plug-and-Play Miners**

There are a number of crypto projects that have launched recently with a physical product that mines their crypto token.  These miners do a lot more than the typical GPU mining, and most contribute directly to the use case of the network.  The only thing they all have in common is that demand greatly exceeds supply – they’re mostly back ordered for months.  Here’s a list of the easiest miners to buy and immediately begin using with minimal technical set-up, called “Plug and Play” mining.

[Helium (HNT)](https://www.thismorningonchain.com/helium-hnt-the-crypto-mined-on-network-hotspots/) - Highly rated ones range from $150 - $430

Helium is a ""proof-of-coverage"" cryptocurrency project operating a global wireless network intended for internet of things (IoT) devices. The Helium network is powered by special hotspots that provide network coverage and mine HNT coins.  As far as the hotspot miners go, there is a wide range, but most are backordered for months.

[Akash (AKT)](https://akash.network/supermini) - $975

Akash Network is the world’s first decentralized open-source cloud, providing faster, more efficient, and lower cost application deployments for high-growth industries including DeFi, decentralized organizations and applications, and machine learning/AI.  Their Supermini is sold out, but was listed at $975.  Technically, this isn’t a miner, but it offers compute power in exchange for tokens.

[Deeper Network (DPR)](https://deeper.network/) - Starts at $249

Deeper Network combines blockchain, network security, and sharing economy to create a global peer-to-peer network that empowers the real users of the internet and paves the way for the next generation of the web.  Deeper Network has a number of devices available and a low electricity footprint.

On the other hand, if you have gone through a few cycles already, the money going up or down may be much more significant than the smaller amounts new people have put in. You may have already put in years of investing and may have been considering taking some gains and are much more hesitant now.

Let's bid up the price juuuuust enough to liquidate them and then buy up all THEIR coins too as the increased supply drops prices back down.

As long as there are enough people who are just begging to be liquidated by over-leveraging, you never have to bid up the price to buy those next 1,000 BTC. People are lining up to give them to you at or relatively near the current price. All you have to do is just be patient and wait.

**2. Unrealistic expectations.** When you look at the current coins being sold today, the majority of them have been bought within the last three to six months. Analytics show that HODLers are still HODLing. It's not them selling. It's the FOMO crowd for the most part which is giving up these coins after a couple of months. So they either bought it with a super short time horizon and unrealistically expecting it to moon immediately, or they intended to hold it long term but invested more than they could afford with the unrealistic expectation that it would moon immediately. Either way, they're providing a steady flow of crypto into whale hands.

So long as we have enough people from these two categories to keep supplying people with cheap crypto, that's all we're likely to ever have: cheap crypto.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3489322,public,self,"The two things holding back crypto prices right now: 1.

That could be timber, oil, steel, microchips, in short: commodities. 

Because of that, and looking at history, commodities have always been a great way to hedge your portfolio against inflation. In the graph below, you can see how bullish phases in the S&amp;P GSCI (an index tracking commodity prices) correlate with high inflation rates.  


https://preview.redd.it/nv602ynk8wo71.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba36515330e80f9605ddeada0281fca094a91739

What does this have to do with cryptocurrencies? Well, in many ways, cryptos like BTC, ETH or ADA essentially \*are\* commodities. Commodities are defined as [products or goods that are more or less uniform in quality](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/021605.asp). When buying gas for your car, you don't really care about where the raw oil came from. Likewise, when buying Bitcoin, it doesn't matter to you at all which of the 21 million tokens you get.

Commodities are often used to engage in some other form of economic activity. Steel is used to build a car, oil becomes gas, flour goes into bread, and so forth. Likewise, cryptocurrencies are used to finance activities for which you would want a decentralized blockchain. Tokens essentially produce transactions, entries in a new block on the ledger. 

I don't get why we even still call them crypto ""currencies"". It's 2021 and hardly anyone uses crypto to actually buy stuff. BCH, LTC, Dash, they're not even in the top 10 anymore. At the same time, [Ethereum users are willing to pay the network 30 million dollar per day](https://cryptofees.info/) to do transactions or operate smart contracts on the blockchain. So, as of today at least, cryptos mainly serve as commodities.

With central banks printing money non-stop for the past decade, and Corona causing disruptions in global supply chains, the effects have started to show in commodity prices. How long will this last? No one knows. Central banks claim the current inflation is temporary, but they've been wrong before. Many investors like Michael Bury or Ray Dalio fear a new normal, with prices going up for the coming years. 

I do feel confident about one prediction: crypto adoption will continue, increasing demand for tokens. It has been rising immensely in the past years and shows no signs of stopping, even growing exponentially. Check out total dollar value parked in DeFi products:

DeFi is already over 1/5 the size of the world's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase ($ 457 billion market cap), after growing almost five-fold within a year. 

If you believe the next few years will give us higher than usual inflation, cryptocurrencies are your perfect hedge. You'll not only buy a commodity, but one whose demand increases rapidly. Best of all, corporations can't increase the production of crypto like they can with Gold or steel, and no central bank can arbitrarily inflate the value of your tokens by minting more.

Granted, volatility is a lot higher than with other commodities.

A few days back, at almost midnight for me, a comprehensive post (15-25 screens) was dropped that outlines the US and coalitions goals and plans for crypto regulation.

It was awe inspiring.  From front to back, it covered everything.  It was obviously the fruit of hundreds and thousands of hours of work.

A few key summaries:


BTC and Ethereum will be classified as commodities.


The rest will be Securities.  Even stable coins.  This will mean possibly many fines for them.  


Mixers and privacy coins will carry prison time.


The US will create a USDC crypto.  A stable coin.


Adjustments to many laws putting definitions of crypto currencies into the law books, removing ambiguity and laying the framework for future compliance and enforcement.


Set requirements of an appointed group to withing 90 days? prepare and classify all cryptocurrencies and a plan of action.  

And within 250 days?  They need to be implementing, following and enforcing it?

(Sorry it was late and the details are not the point of this talk.  I will find his post after I post this)

End



There was more but I wanted to discuss what happens next.

The US and other commonwealth countries will pass and enforce these regulations.  Cryptocurrencies will face massive fines.  Some may die as a result.  I suspect coins with no use will hurt bad.

But!  Some will emerge.  BTC, ETH, ___, ____, ____,

And those that do, will be ready for mainstream adoption.  Do you think it was a coincidence that Pay Pal only added BTC, ETH, and BCH?

This leaves us in turbulent violent times.  The market is no longer completely free.  Many of us have alts and should consider redistribution to BTC.

* There are innovations in the Bitcoin whitepaper that Satoshi put out about 12 years ago. Satoshi's Bitcoin has been a catalyst to change in finance. It's pushing central bankers to reconsider how to provide better payment systems. I dedicated years to study and teach it. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it was interesting and innovative.

* SEC's job is to protect investors from fraud. In the world of finance, it's human nature that people come along and try to sell something exaggerate in the classics of hucksters in the world.

* If these 6000 different tokens have the attributes of an investment contract or attributes of equities or bonds, they are a security. Trading and lending platforms have hundreds and thousands of tokens that fit the definition of a security.

* These platforms have not registered with us. We're going to keep bringing these enforcement cases but there's going to be a problem and a lot of people are going to get hurt. This field is rife with fraud and abuse and hucksters.

* If you raise money from the public and they are relying on you to build a platform with an anticipation of profits, that's an investment contract. It's a straightforward idea.

* There are platforms trading securities, platforms that have lending products and what's called staking products. With staking coins you put a coin at the platform and you earn a return. They can come in and we'll figure out how best to get them within the perimeter. We'll also be bringing those enforcement actions as well.

* Stablecoins are acting like poker chips at the casino right now. SEC is working with the banking regulators on stablecoins.

Most people desire a decent level of wealth.

Its not about lambos, its about having a decent level of freedom &amp; security.

It's about being able to look after your loved ones when times are hard.

It's about having the freedom to do what you want , when you want.

Most people don't have the bottle for it.

They will sell when they get a +25%, +50% or x2 gain on anything.

And they will definitely sell it when it goes down by more then -25% .

Thats true for Amazon ten years ago &amp; BTC today.

&amp;#x200B;

You see these people look at the Amazon or Facebook stock chart &amp; they don't zoom in.

They ignore the extreme volatility of the day to day, week to week.

They forget the FUD, the naysers.

They forgot the mainstream media laughing at Bezos &amp; regarding Amazon as a sham.

Even if they got in early they wouldn't have the nerve to hold &amp; ride it for the long term.

I was once one of these people too.

But heres the thing. You learn.

Experience teaches you and it hardens you.

So as China begins to collapse and global markets wobble, ask yourself the question.

Where do you want to be in ten years?

Do you want to be like everyone else, wishing they had got in early.

Or do you want to be the 1% that understand the nature of volatility and ride it all the way.

**POC Chart Analysis**  
Here you go... as i was starting my crypto experience in march 21 i did what every human does all the time, if you are aware of it or not... i tried to see patterns and interpret those patterns. Some days i just thought that\`s all rubbish and it\`s impossible to think about patterns when the future is involved. No one knows the future, right ?  


**WRONG!**

Well, if Einstein was right and God doesnt play dice, then the future is predictable if you have enough knowledge about the underlying physical effects. if everything is based on mathematics, then it should be possible to calculate the future... you just need to know ""some"" variables.... TAKE THAT, HEISENBERG !   


So i analyzed the market every single day and came up with my own chart analysis. It\`s called the **Power of Cats (POC)**. What you are seeing is bitcoins behaviour in forming cats with their paws up... like they were waving to you happily. why cats? Because after all, even if we all love dogs, the Internet STARTED WITH CATZ (i can haz cheezeburger?!) and admit it or not, cats rule since the egyptians. My guess is now, that the human collective is forming those cats unknowingly. it\`s mass psychology.   


**What does this mean for the BTC Market?**  
As soon as the second smaller cat this year is drawn, the third Cat will come to exist. The Powercat.  
Think about it, 3 cats of the same size would be boring. you have to have a big cat, then a smaller one and at last, the biggest of them all. It\`s like the golden cut. I predict the cats feet at 60k, the cats paws at 100k and the cats ears (or all time high as some of you may call it) at **118k !**

They got on my radar cause you always see people from their top management do interviews with the likes of Bloomberg and podcasts with the Pomp himself. I have to say that they are usually very eloquent, but daaaaamn young if you ask me.

Here are some of the red flags I spotted:

1) you cannot download the app directly from the apple app store, instead you have to do it via TestFlight, and as far as I know this is used for beta versions of apps

2) no mention of any kind of insurance to protect depositors (a la Celsius or BlockFi), they just highlight that they are using legit custodians like BitGo

# What is FXA? 

Built on open-sourced algorithms for use by anyone. Anyone can become a developer and earn FXAT based on performance. There will be two tokens FXAT and FXAG. The utility difference is FXAT is used by FXA Technologies to pay the developers. FXAG is used by the community to purchase the algorithms and day-to-day transactions. We have created two tokens to minimise the volatility in FXAT and allow hyper-growth in FXAG. Developers will be able to swap FXAT for FXAG in our exchange. 

FXA TECHNOLOGIES has two decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens with one main purpose and three functions during each transaction. The main purpose of FXA is to support an open-sourced community of algorithmic developers that can be used globally by anyone in the FXA community.

​Developers are rewarded in FXAT based on their performance and paid in FXAG by their algorithmic users. Allowing data scientists, quants, and developers to transact and express their work to the worldwide community.

​The three functions of the token are automatic distribution, auto-liquidity generating protocol, and automatic burning on each transaction. Holders of the FXAG will receive more tokens each time a transaction takes place.

​FXA was launched by a team of algorithmic traders and developers at FXA Technologies. Unlike traditional algorithmic traders, the FXA team wants to open source their findings and allow anyone to copy and benefit from the algorithms. Creating a follower and creator environment that everyone can benefit from.

One of the main features of the FXA is developers are rewarded tokens based on performance, this means the token becomes more valuable as more developers and users join the community.

What I'm getting at is I worry the investors are intentionally premining a large amount and holding it off the market to make the market cap look good and draw in the general public. But if all the coins mined were freely traded the price would collapse. The price is being held up by sequestering coins from the primine, but those coins are still used in calculating the market cap.

Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin in the aftermath specifically to create a safe haven for those of us who want no part of such things.

It's time to sit back and let bitcoin work. But, it went down 10% yesterday? Yeah two reasons. 
1. Leveraged longs got liquidated. Everytime there is a spike down it causes a cascade of liquidations. You can make a lot of money using leverage but you are inevitably going going to get rekt on some or most of your trades. If you are really lucky or really good or both you can avoid that happening more than 50% of the time. Not my cup of tea but more power to you if you can pull it off. The unwinding of an over-leveraged market is natural and healthy. No it's not a conspiracy, no it's not whales targeting retail, it's a natural part of the market finding equilibrium.

2. Panic selling by weak hands. This is not unique to BTC. Speculative investors looking to make a quick profit without understanding what they are investing in are the first to dump any investment. Dumb money buys at the top and sells at the first sign of trouble. This has always been the case with bitcoin as adoption continues to increase at an exponential rate.

The panic sellers, well most of them will be back. Hopefully with a little more knowledge and faith. More people will study and learn about what is going on in China with a massive overvalued and overleveraged debt bubble about to burst. And they will look around and see that while Evergrande might be on the extreme end of the spectrum, the same issues pervade every traditional financial market. More people will discover that the world's debt to GDP ratio is exploding at an unsustainable rate, and that our central banks are printing us straight off a cliff. Those people will be searching for a way to get out. And they will discover the best asset ever created that can credibly enforce a fixed supply of 21 million.

The network is unchanged. BTC is the same today as it was yesterday. Smart money, long term holders are accumulating. I am not a maxi. I own other crypto for other reasons that were designed with other utility in mind. Bitcoin's purpose and utility was designed for this very reason with what we are seeing in China. It's BTC's time shine, and our time to hodl, accumulate, and patiently wait for BTC to do it's job.

In 2011, Erik Finman was just 12 years old when he received a generous gift of $1,000 from his grandmother. Most other kids his age would use the money to buy a new smartphone or the latest video game console, but Erik decided to invest everything in Bitcoin.

That decision had paid off big time because Bitcoin was valued at $1,200 a piece just two years later, which is when he decided to sell his Bitcoins and use the money his investment had earned him to launch an online education company called Botangle, a web venture providing video tutoring services.

It didn’t take a long time for Botangle to catch the attention of investors, who presented Erik with a seemingly difficult choice: sell the company for either $100,000 or 300 Bitcoins. For Erik, however, there was just one answer, and you already know what it was. Yes, Erik decided to bet everything on Bitcoin one more time. Why? Perhaps because he made a bet with his parents that if he turned 18 and was a millionaire, they wouldn’t force him to go to college.

“I can proudly say I made it, and I’m not going to college,” said Erik in an interview with CNBC. “The way the education system is structured now, I wouldn’t recommend it. It doesn’t work for anyone.

if you want to support the enviroment, electric cars and crypto, **this** could definitely be something for you!

A startup company here in Austria established a car sharing platform with electric cars (tesla &amp; bmw i3) only. Currently, they have ""tokenized"" 11 tesla cars of the fleet, which means that people all around the globe have the oppurtunity to invest in their token (EOT) and be a active ""shareholder"" of the company.  
The sales of the tokenized cars are splitted 50/50 with the company and all token holders / shareholders, so you have a good oppurtunity to start your passive income with blockchain and car sharing combined. The tokens are very limited ... you can only buy EOT when a new car gets tokenized.  
(Announcements regarding token sales are made on their Instagram page and their Telegram group.)

For your info:  
1 Tesla = **85000** **EOT**  
1 EOT = € 1,10

They try to make everything as transparent as possible for token holders. (you can see sales and losses of every day and car, which cars are currently booked, out of service and so on ...) -&gt; see picture

If you want to become a token holder, you have to sign up [here](https://eloop.one/) and complete KYC. 

[Eloop Vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/4n6qnu9yqvo71.png?width=1883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c9ccaa13816051ceaa3dc04329b3e502cecbdcc)

The normal car sharing app can be downloaded in the app store.  
They have very fair prices and good conditions (also for multiple day journeys), so feel free to use ELOOP when coming to Austria/Vienna. (soon maybe also in your country)

In my opinion this is a great idea and i love driving with these teslas. (if you buy EOT, you also get a good amount of free credits for the carsharing app, so you can drive and test them for free)

when devs get criticism or even genuine concern about their projects whether it be utility or future possible use cases, they usually just call it FUD; so they could avoid answering and just leave the people concerned about the future of their investment/possible investment.

we all know that spreading fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt is a real thing and can influence a lot of people; but generally, when the devs can’t deliver answers to criticism/questions is a red flag.
we have seen that happen few times. devs keep calling criticism FUD to keep stalling until they pull the rug

# What is it?

Stellar Lumens is a blockchain that aims to speed up and make money transactions in different currencies cheaper.  Launched in 2015, it has already seen nearly 500 million operations carried out on its blockchain. Transfers are possible thanks to the mediation of the Lumen token.  Stellar Lumens is characterized by its speed and low commissions.

# How does it work?

Every time a deposit is made within the network, new tokens are issued in a 1: 1 ratio.  People who use this system have a wallet at their disposal that can also be put in contact with their own home banking. In addition to making payments to other bank accounts, those who receive the tokens will also be able to exchange them for traditional currency.  Therefore, Stellar Lumens acts as an intermediary between two operators, but without the costs and waiting times that traditional ones usually employ.  The geographical borders between the different countries are thus demolished, allowing anyone to exchange money and make purchases easily.  The Stellar Blockchain monitors ownership, acting as an authentic accounting “ledger”, controlled by a network of independent computers that check the records every five seconds.  The algorithm used is the ""***Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)***"", designed to work with any type of traditional currency. The forwarding of balances and transactions takes place every 5 seconds and the cost of each transaction is quite low: 0.00001 dollars. Think instead of the commissions charged by banks or money transfers for the same operations.  The ""nodes"" of the blockchain are represented by servers, which run the ""core software"" of the network, taking care of publishing and checking the registry.  Each time an operation is scheduled, the nodes verify that the right amount of tokens has been debited/credited.  A copy of all transactions carried out within the blockchain is also kept inside the servers.  The Stellar network is made up of hundreds of nodes around the world, which communicate with each other through a shared algorithm and software. It is therefore impossible to attack the blockchain with cyber attacks of the ""denial of service"" type. Stellar Lumens is also distinguished by the fact that it can connect itself to the endpoints to be converted into fully spendable traditional currency.  The blockchain already enjoys several important partnerships, such as IBM, basically the longest-running American computer company in business.

Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for XLM are Keybase, Solar Wallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice. 

Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Great and functional blockchain
2. Fast and cheap transactions
3. XLM is already a working product
4. You can earn XLM by using a Coinbase debit card

**Cons**

1. A lot of competition (XRP is an example)
2. Circulating supply is way less than total supply

Leverage Trade without Risk Management.. A Quick (Painful) Story”

Background: 
I’m still a newbie, only being invested in crypto for about 9 months. I’ve grown from yoloing into Doge at 7 cents to DCA and hodling Top 10 coins (with a couple lower cap still in the Top 100).

Story time:
After trading a percentage of my portfolio and only seeing minor gains, I found an awesome project on KuCoin that gives back great passive income. The issue is I needed $500 to reach my goal number of coins.

I transfer $2000 into my margin account to try to quickly get the extra 25%. It starts off smooth, already up $250 with an ADA long. The next day, my stop loss hits and I’m down $100. This is where the disasters start. 

Now, I start getting aggravated I didn’t take profit off the trade and ended up losing out. Revenge trading ensues. 

I start using more money in each trade to make back the small loss and get to my goal. Down another $150 and here comes AVAX. Promising project, already had a bullish run and looks like it’s bouncing off support so I buy in. This time, I’m confident I can trade my money back so instead of a stop loss, I set lower buy limits. These buy limits hit throughout the day and now I’m 5% (or 25% using the 5x leverage) from being liquidated. 

I remember it like it was yesterday, because it was just 2 weeks ago, my girlfriend and I planned a nice day of little dates to the zoo then the movies. An hour into the zoo, my phone blows up saying my AVAX account was liquidated $750. 

A flow of emotions run rampant through me, but I look up and see her ecstatic because the elephants were walking towards us so she could get a better picture! (She loves bringing her Canon camera everywhere to never miss a moment). Even with the thought of losing over a weeks paycheck in a couple days due to stupid decisions, I couldn’t help but smile at her happiness and a moment of bliss passes over me.

It was at this moment I realized how emotionally invested I was in crypto when I should save my emotions for the people that matter.

That’s a huge amount of liquidity to add to a system in one go and could lead to some price movements comparable to a “rug pull” as people with their ETH locked away for over a year take profits.

Each crypto-signal channel is operated by someone who considers themselves a specialist in that cryptocurrency.

📌 Midas Investments

Generally, it is an ecosystem of intuitive products assisting investors to create long-term passive income streams in growing crypto markets. The server’s content consists of market updates and guides about DeFi and staking automated instruments with transparent risks and high yield, discussions on new projects &amp; ideas, etc.

Tezos  blockchain has received its newest upgrade proposal for the global  Tezos community. The Hangzhou proposal sets the Tezos ecosystem up for  the upcoming 2022 consensus upgrade and also introduces a number of new  technical tools and patches.

The proposal was named after the global technology and innovation hub  located in China—Zhejiang province. The update was presented with the  usage of on-chain governance that allows network updates without hard  forks.

The constant development of Tezos at the protocol level has led to  the expansion of Tezos' Dapp system. By decreasing transaction costs and  time, builders have more possibilities for building and developing apps  on top of the Tezos blockchain. In general, it has led to the increased  growth of the Tezos community in recent months. Recently, Tezos reached  over three million contract calls and set numerous records in DeFi and  NFT metrics, doubling last month's results.

The most recent upgrade proposal brings several major upgrades to the  protocol. The new upgrade presents views that offer the possibility for  smart contracts to read other smart contracts and cache results with  lower gas costs. The upgrade will also add a Global Table of Constants  that will be used to allow smart contract developers to register  Michelson expressions as constants. This means that they will be able to  build more complex contracts and libraries based on Tezos.

To optimize the functioning of smart contracts on the network, the  upgrade brings Context Flattening, which allows optimization of block  processing and operations. In addition to that, the network welcomes  Liquidity baking, which allows for a more stable transition to the next  upgrade proposal.

Tezos already has seven upgrades since last month's Granada upgrade.  The network has also faced a record number of interactions than ever  before, which means that more people are using Tezos. The main reason  for this is protocol upgrades that are possible through on-chain  governance.

The Hangzhou proposal was developed by Marigold, DaiLambda, Nomadic Labs, Tarides and Oxhead Alpha.

Everyone says DYOR! And that’s my motto too. Then I get to know Crypton (CRP). From my criteria to evaluate tokens, I found CRYPTON highly genuine and potentially strong. I have seen many projects failing, many Scammers stealing large amounts of money. For some projects, that look good, they won’t even improve their rank on trusted sites like CMC and win investor’s attraction.

But for CRP it is different. It has gained popularity for its totally anonymized and fully decentralized behavior. Anyone can go and check its rank on CMC for starters. PoS the most efficient rewarding system I like on crypto is found on CRP as well. That is exciting! I can harvest my CRPs through staking. No worries about affecting the environment. It’s PoS!! (You know Proof of Stake right? :)

A satisfying growth! ;-)

Keep in mind my photo shop abilities are about zero and my artistic abilities are bad.

# Process

I was more interested to see what the NFT scene was about than to make NFTs a business. I tried multiple networks and sites. I listed between 1 and 5 on each site depending on the costs. I did not do any outside advertising outside of the sites default mechanism. I did not explore the process on ETH, but you can mint on OpenSea via MATIC and via Mintable for free.

# Binance Smart Chain

**AirNFTs** (success)

Cost: \~$3

It was easy to create an NFT on AirNFT. A downside is that the cost to list was related to file size. This really skews the images to being lower file size. I find that the search function did not really work well.

No sales. The default search and advertising is not that great, would not recommend without outside advertising.

**BakerySwap** (failure)

Cost: \~$5

The NFT was minted and it never appeared. I then went through the block explorer, got the token ID and looked and saw that it was minted, but not approved by BakerySwap. I did not spend any additional effort to figure it out.

# Tezos

**ByteBlock** (success)

Cost: \~$0.50 to create, \~$0.20 to list, based on size

It was seamless to create an NFT on ByteBlock. The NFT appeared in my Tezos wallet without an issue. After I created the NFT I was able to list it for sale. This is not the highest end market. You pay gas and a storage fee which is influenced by the size of the NFT you are selling.

Sales. Good network for $5-$50 sales. You are advertised on the front page until more listings come along. If I did not get a sale within 48 hours, it did not sell.

**Bazaar Market** (1/2 success)

Cost: \~$0.50 to create, \~$0.20 to list, based on size, comparable to ByteBlock

I like the Bazaar interface. It was easy to create the NFT, but it has been stuck in pending for days and no NFT was created. The second attempt did work without a long time in pending.

Sales. Lower volume site so it had a long time on the front page.

**Hicetnunc** (failure)

Hicetnunc did not have an easy to use interface. The marketplace was having server errors and was down for creating NFTs. I later came back and used Hicetnunc with OBJKT. The listing fees for OBJKT were \~$1.25, but it seemed to have higher quality art.

Hicetnunc is good place to list art, but you need to do outside advertising to drive sales.

# Algorand

**Algogems**

Cost: $0

Algogems lets you mint NFTs and list them for sale for free. You list via an auction and can determine the length of the auction. They have a NSFW section.

No sales, since it is free to list items get booted off the front page fast. You get a little bit on the front page before the auction comes due. I might consider a lot of 24 hour auctions for cheap prices if I was going to continue with Algogems.

# Costs and Profits

**Listing Expenses: $24.56**

**Sales: $36.71**

**Profit: $12.15**

I have no idea who actually purchased my ""art"" and find it amusing that it actually sold. I think that even without artistic abilities that you can make money with NFT ""art"".

We say it in the name currency. However, the way some of the top projects are as of now they could never be used as a currency. BTC &amp; ETH are the top two cryptos, as we all know. However, BTC from its inception is up several thousands of percent with predictions this year alone to go further into the 6 digits. ETH is also predicted to more than 3x from this current price of 3k. There are two main reasons why I can't see myself using these projects and many other promising chains as a form of payment.

1. Using your coins as a form of payment is a taxable event that will require you to pay capital gains taxes. If you were a SOL investor at say $50. Then you held to $200 and used SOL as a payment method to get IDK a new car... You now bought that car and paid for it but also need to pay the capital gains tax of your country. Why in the world would I choose to do this?
2. Using your coins as currency is forfeiting an appreciating asset for likely a depreciating one or a stagnant asset. And that assumes you are getting another asset. If you use it for a consumable like drink/food game over its not even an asset. Why would I trade my asset that is gaining value for another that certainly will lose it or stagnate. You could look back 10 years from now and say that baseball game and hot dog cost me $100 when it was $35 at the time. 
3. Transactions fees and speed of transactions. This one actually isn't to big a deal. Many chains like XLM, ADA and soooo many others I am not going to list actually are not a problem when it comes to tx fees and speed. But the ETH certainly is. Why would I pay all that gas for a small time transaction. Same for BTC why would I make a $20 purchase with a tx fee of $8 or $12. imagine your sales tax being that high. And god help you if you are at the register trying to use these coins and the network had a spike in usage and you are just sitting there waiting for the tx to go through. 

In short, there are certainly projects out there that could be used as currency. But we see BTC being the main adopter and understandably so it is the OG and most trusted. But for reasons described I treat my crypto as a form of investing and would not make transactions with it that do not benefit the use of crypto when it comes to increasing my portfolio's worth.

I just wanted to talk about some things with you guys and explain to you all why my mining rig has been 24/7 mining Ravencoin for the past 6 months. 

First off, I honestly am just in love with the project. That's the simple way to put it. I honestly think Ravencoin is digital gold. It is used to create assets and those assets are valued by RVN. Just like how back in the day gold coins were minted and after that currency went into the gold standard. This just makes me love the project. 

Secondly, I have it on a strong faith that RVN is going to see a large influx of miners after ETH 2.0 happens to look for a new coin to mine. A lot of people are saying they are going to ergo but if you look at profitability RVN beats it in almost all cases.

Third, RVN is halving in January, combined with the new large influx of new miners to RVN... well you guys can use your imaginations.

RVN is the future in many ways and pretty soon (relatively speaking) we will start to see more talk about it.

Hi everyone, 

I'm a total noob to the crypto space (no personal decentralized wallets, only centralized exchange accounts). I'm a Physical Therapist by trade, and had to stop working due to long haul covid, starting about 10 months ago. Starting to see some health progress, but not ready to return to full time in clinic work right now. 

There are some things I can do from home, like providing home office ergonomics assessments, personal training/coaching, and even consultation calls, fielding Physical Therapy or workout related questions. These are all activities that are not typically reimbursed by insurance, and in a fiat world I charge cash out of pocket for these services. I'm interested in starting to charge for these services in crypto. 

From a legal standpoint, I just need a few waivers and liability insurance, among other things. But I'd like some guidance or links to some easy to comprehend guides on best practices for setting up wallets, payments etc.

Blockchain is a distributed public ledger that records cryptocurrencies transactions. The maintenance of this blockchain ledger is performed by a network of communicating nodes running same version of blockchain software. Every digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin or any other has its own blockchain software platform, a ledger and a community of miners.

In the last 10 years or so, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology has overcome all blockades in its way, destroying all kinds of myths and cynicism. Passionate followers have not only adopted these digital currencies but they have been fast enough to update themselves with this ever changing technology. With total crypto marketcap at $500+ billions, millions of transactions are executed each day as blockchain technology is being adopted by top level companies. Therefore, in this fast changing world it would be worth knowing, how to store and secure your precious Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies using digital wallets.

What is a Digital Wallet?

Similar to fiat currencies, digital currencies need to be managed and stored somewhere. As we keep dollar bills securely in a wallet so do we need to store our digital currencies like Bitcoin in wallets.

A digital wallet refers to a smart electronic device or a software program that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online. This can include sending-receiving digital currencies or purchasing items with a computer, tablet, smartphone or any other smart device. A digital wallet uses software for proving authenticity of device/user, based on information stored in device itself. So a digital wallet has both a software and information component inside it. The software in combination with information like password, pin or a master key provides required minimal security and encryption for online transactions. There are two types of digital wallets available in the market: One is operated at client side or user side, where private keys are stored on user device itself. Another type of digital wallet can be maintained at server side and private keys are usually stored on the service provider server or exchange. The latter one is slightly easier to operate for end user as most of the setup hassle is handled by the exchange. Let us explore these digital wallets further.

Crypto Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins, basically, a master key (private key to be more specific). These are special digital wallets used to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin etc and sometimes also called as Crypto Wallets. Like normal wallets, one can add, send or receive digital currencies from crypto wallets using private keys. These private keys/master keys are generated using strong cryptographic algorithms. This master key is used to authenticate a device/person identity to a wallet system. Once user identity is verified only then can someone make crypto transactions. Usually private keys are made up of alphanumeric strings of different lengths. A cryptocurrency wallet stores public and private key combination, which can be used to buy or send the cryptocurrency from your address to new address. A wallet can contain multiple pairs of public and private keys.

How Does it Actually Works?

Cryptocurrency transactions work much like a traditional banking system and needs to trust on third party service providers usually a cryptocurrency exchange or a miner, in case you are not running a full node. This third party exchange/miner keeps record of all cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain, acting as a fully functional digital ledger. These service providers have huge computation power and charge a nominal fee for operational cost coverage.

Unlike banking systems these crypto systems are decentralized and all work in a democratic way, by majority agreement. Service providers usually link the individual wallet to their core wallet. So just like with a bank for debit or credit card, the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Even though crypto wallets are extremely safe, sometimes due to poor management of private keys by exchanges, hackers can trick system to steal user’s cryptocurrencies. This happened in the case of Mt. Gox exchange hacking in Japan, where exchange lost most of their clients’ bitcoins in a single hack incident.

Similar to how bank allocates a unique savings account number to a user, crypto exchanges assign a unique Digital Address (an alphanumeric string) and a unique Private Key to a user. This crypto address is just like your bank account number and can be shared publicly without any concerns of hacking. Only a person having access to private key of a digital address can view and operate transactions from that account. Private key is used for authentication during sending and receiving bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. On the other hand, access to the receiving wallet is not required for sending any cryptocurrency. Sender only needs to know the destination address and anyone can send cryptocurrency to that address.

If the private key of a crypto wallet is not compromised/leaked then it is almost impossible to break into your digital account. Its a well known fact that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA, has the highest computational power on earth. It is mathematically calculated that if all of NSA computational power is used even then it may take years to break into your digital account with brute force hacking method. These systems are so secure that if you forgot or lose the secret private key for your account then your bitcoins and cryptos are lost forever.

At present, there are four varieties of cryptocurrecy wallets widely in use.

Web Wallet:

A web wallet is a web based service that allows users to store and control their private keys and other useful information at a service provider server. All crypto transactions are performed by using any standard web browser like Google Chrome. While using a web wallet user private keys are managed by a third party provider. Due to several Bitcoin and other crypto hacking incidents several exchanges have started providing two-factor-authentication (2FA) feature to their customers.

A common example of a web wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW). One can further visit [https://www.myetherwallet.com/](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) to know more about how this web wallet works. The most important thing to remember is, user should always make sure whether they are using the right URL/website and if the entire communication from your browser to server is encrypted using “https” protocol. If a website is not starting with https, always avoid it to create any accounts or send and receive any crypto currencies.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost.  
No need to carry an extra device while you are travelling or outside home.

**Cons:**  
Unsafe as hackers and keyloggers can hack your account and steal your funds.  
Difficult to transact on a public wifi.

Software Wallet:

A software wallet is like any desktop application installed locally on your computer, or a mobile app installed on your Android or iOS based smart devices. For example, ImToken Mobile Wallet app is installed and used as we use any other app from Google Play or iPhone App stores. IMtoken is among the best software wallets with ample features supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. However, all software wallets might have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be used by hackers to perform illegal transactions from your digital wallet. With software wallet you have the option of using the same private key for your software wallet as well as web wallet. But for all cases securing your private key is utmost important.  
IMtoken is downloadable on both Android and iOS.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost as most apps are freely available.  
Much more secure than Web Wallet.

**Cons:**  
Require regular software updates with product version releases.  
For security reasons a user needs to remove all data related to app when changing or selling the device.

Paper Wallet:

Paper wallets are yet another kind of wallets used for cryptocurrencies management. Individuals can print their digital addresses and private keys in the form of a QR code on a piece of paper. This piece of paper acts as a physical wallet and should be always kept at a safe place. Actually, it provides pretty good security as private key is stored offline and not vulnerable to hacking. However, this advantage is only applicable till private key is on paper. Once you enter the private key in a wallet to operate your transaction then it is equally vulnerable as is your underlying OS and software. Infact, there is additional hassle of entering private key again and again. Although one can use barcode reader but that again leaves a loophole in the safe operation of private key.

**Pros:**  
Easy to store and can be kept in a cupboard or a physical safe.  
Since it is stored offline its always protected from hackers.  
Its portable as it is much easy to carry paper and can be kept in a normal fiat wallet.

**Cons:**  
Can be easily destroyed intentionally or unintentionally.

Hardware Wallet:

These days our computers and smart devices are always connected with internet. Each device usually have multiple apps, web browsers and softwares. These web browsers and apps can have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited by a seasoned hacker. Moreover, it was found from a survey that end users tend to ignore regular software updates, posing great risk to their device and investments. Its a possibility that private keys on an internet connected device are compromised. These are some of the loopholes exploited by hackers during several Bitcoin and other high value cryptocurrencies hacks.

Hardware wallet is the best existing solution to all of these hacking concerns, as user private key is never shared with anyone and never leaves the hardware device. When a hardware wallet performs a transaction, wallet’s software creates an encrypted value from the private key. This encrypted value is then shared with the remote device (or exchange) to complete authentication of the transaction. This way hardware wallet provides the best security among all digital wallets.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the best hardware wallet companies with a variety of products with different safety features. Both companies have created devices that require user to physically enter a pin by pressing button on the device to finally trigger the transaction. Some hardware wallets also have addition layer of security where user is required to enter a secret pin to open the hardware wallet. All these new safety devices and features have forced hackers to burn more midnight oil. If a user is taking all precautions then it is almost impossible to hack such devices by anyone.

**Pros:**  
Extremely secure as private keys are never exposed.  
Since it is a stand alone, separate device chances of virus infection are minimal.  
Devices have additional layer of security possible like pressing a button or pin entry.  
You can do transactions safely even on public wifi networks.  
Can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies.

**Cons:**  
Usually hardware wallets are expensive. A good hardware wallet can easily cost $100 plus.  
Device should always be with you to make any transaction.

create a ML trading bot with the sole purpose to make money and send 10k USD out to all active ETH/BTC addresses. The goal would be to hand out a certain amount of money to the entire population. Poorest ones could be prioritized, multiple parallel bots could run to reach specific goals too. This would be nicely augmented by charity donations.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic idea is to create an algorithm/business processes that would insure that all the active participants of the digital economy would be given a specific amount of resources - fresh start money type of thing.  As far as I know big tech is already busy insuring that everybody participates - freeish phones + freeish satellite Internet access. The plausibility of this idea is greatly increased by upcoming proof-of-humanity projects.

On a theoretical note, is it possible to design a system, where some predetermined amount of value (10k in this example) would be automatically extracted from the market on the behalf of each human turn by turn?

### The NFT Series Around Tupac Shakur

NFTs allow for any digital format to  be registered on blockchain and record ownership. We’ve seen the  industry grow fast and we’ve already seen some drops by musicians on  Tezos platforms like Junkie XL and Doja Cat.  

Other names that have been announced to do NFT drops on Tezos are Quincy Jones, John Legend, TLC and The Estate Of Whitney Houston.

The  price range is diverse, some of these NFT’s are sold for as much as 1  XTZ, while others sell for much higher amounts. One of the Doja Cat NFTs  sold for ***$188,888.00.*** 

In the next few months, an NFT series  around the legendary rapper Tupac will become available. The following  NFT’s will be dropped:

**– The ‘Born Busy’ documentary, covering Tupac’s early days while attending the Baltimore School for the Arts.**

Includes interviews with teachers, classmates, and  old neighborhood friends give some intimate insights about that period  of Tupac’s life and aspirations.

**– Several versions of the book ‘Back in the Day: my life and times with Tupac Shakur’ with a new audio excerpt from Bastfield.**

The book is a memoir of Tupac’s teenage years,  written by Darrin Keith Bastfield, who met Tupac at the Baltimore School  for the Arts in 1986. Bastfield and Tupac became close friends and  started a rap group during that period called ‘Born Busy’ with Dana  Smith, and Gerard Young.

The book will drop in 18 separate  chapters, with a new cover for every chapter. The covers will be paired  with hand-drawn art on the pages which will be literally cut out of the  actual book.

**– The cover of ‘Back in the Day: my life and times with Tupac  Shakur’, which will replace the initial published cover with  Bastfield’s oil painting ‘Shakurspeare’.**

“*Tupac posed for me as a teenager after sharing his love and aspirations of being a Shakespearean Actor.*” -Darrin Keith Basfield

**-A First Draft Edition screenplay also titled ‘Shakurspeare’.**

A romantic comedy that delves into the controversial world of art, written by Darrin Keith Bastfield.

More details about release dates, the  amount of editions, and if and how any rights are attached to a buy of  one of these NFT’s will follow later.

There will be a series of pre-drops  every week starting next Tuesday until the official launch date of the  actual documentary. Expected is that the ‘Born Busy’ documentary will be  released in December. 

A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the NFT’s will be used to  support art initiatives and programs that actively fosters art and  culture to youth in urban communities.

Next Tuesday, Sep 28 at 7:00 PM EDT, Darrin will host a Clubhouse event [here](https://clubhouse.com/event/MKJ2qK6J), where he will discuss Born Busy.

Users will be able to collect a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocols) NFT for free. **“*****DJ Booman*** ***will be working with me and adding the musical background to the event.*****”**

There is a Clubhouse event planned every week, in which Bastfield  will take out a page of the book “Back in the Day: my life and times  with Tupac Shakur”, on which he will create live art, with feedback from  the people that attend the Clubhouse event.

This page will be an NFT that will accompany a cover of the chapter  of the book that will be released that week as NFT on Kalamint.

### Darrin Keith Bastfield

The NFTs are minted by Darrin Keith  Bastfield, early friend of Tupac and member of the Baltimore rap group  that Tupac was a part of: ‘Born Busy’, Bastfield completely owns the  rights to the material that will be used for the NFT’s. 

He is the writer of the book ‘Back in the Day: my life and times with  Tupac Shakur’ first published as a hardcover in 2002 by Random  House/One World/Ballantine and then as a Paperback in 2003.

Darrin is also the creator, Producer, and Director of the documentary  ‘Born Busy.’ Bastfield is also co-owner of a series of unreleased Tupac  recordings that were created while he was part of the rap group “Born  Busy”.

These are the first-ever recorded tracks of Tupac rapping. Perhaps someday those recordings will be officially released.

Darrin Keith Bastfield is a talented  artist in many disciplines. After the Tupac-related NFT series, you will  be seeing more art of him dropped in later NFT series.

Bastfield and Tupac met at the  Baltimore School for the Arts in 1986. They became close friends and  eventually started a rap group called Born Busy. Darrin tells how he and  Tupac got introduced and became close friends:

&gt;*Tupac and I met at the Baltimore School for the Arts in 1986. We  would see each other in passing and would speak especially soon after I  found out that he loved to rap from mutual classmates, just like I did.  Tupac was an underclassmen and new to the school so he was not yet known  at that time.*  
 *He also heard about me rapping along with my other friends who  were all upperclassmen. One day after school Tupac sees me and another  friend standing out in front of the school talking and just interrupts  us and asked me if I want to battle.*   
 He was so cocky that my immediate  response was ”Yeah”, and then in  my mind seconds later was “Who are you again..what type of battle are  you talking about?” It happened so fast.  
 Well, we battled at the school during a yearly Beaux Arts Ball event  and Tupac and his then unknown friend Dana won the battle against three  of us.  
 After that battle I was very impressed. It was obvious that they  rehearsed a great deal and came prepared. Others who were with me were a  bit sour and would downplay Tupac’s  battle performance. Not me. I gave  credit where credit was due, however that summer all I would think  about was a rematch.  
 One day I was walking to the lunch room and I heard a bunch of beats  made on lockers inside the boys locker room. I go in and it’s Tupac with  a few other theatre students and Tupac’s looks over to me and says  “Darrin, kick a rhyme!” I jumped right in.  
 *This was the ice breaking moment between Tupac and I. After that  moment when we would see each other in the school hallways, he would  always ask me if I wrote any new rhymes and vice versa. We begin  building a friendship.*  
 ***Then one day, a group of about 8 guys came down to the  Baltimore School for the Arts after school to fight Tupac. As we later  found out this was all over a girl.***   
 Me and my other friends stood with Tupac and really had his back  during that altercation. Because I knew that there was a chance that the  guys would try to catch him going home after leaving the school, I went  home with him as he lived on the opposite side of town.  
 I didn’t want anyone to catch him alone. I took the bus with him all the way to his home on the Northeast side of Baltimore.  
 I met his mother as he introduced me and told her (Afeni Shakur) that  I had his back. She immediately thanked me and would have a talk with  both of us. From that day on we spent a lot of time hanging together and  even got jobs working at the same restaurant as busboys.  
 We then formed a rap group called ‘Born Busy.’ All we did was write  raps and when we decided to form the group we had to come up with a  name. I came up with Born Busy and we started writing songs with the  ‘Born Busy’ name in the songs.  
 *Our first song together is called ‘Check it Out.’ We wrote a total  of 8 songs together and recorded them. They have never been officially  released.*",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3488605,public,self,"Good day for Crypto: New Tupac Shakur Rapper Documentary, Major Published Book And Artwork Will Drop On Tezos NFT",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/psjhoc/good_day_for_crypto_new_tupac_shakur_rapper/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,"{'7azcqvbb6vo71': {'e': 'Image', 'id': '7azcqvbb6vo71', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02818aa24160c282f7a17234449655ed1f7465bd', 'x': 108, 'y': 46}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2838edd893b972d961a14ffb0e1da045623578ad', 'x': 216, 'y': 92}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc179a7e4ab7f0cd00818af25f9b451c0c9f5225', 'x': 320, 'y': 136}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a80c614b05768fa1fda40e7ac51ef66ba7974a06', 'x': 640, 'y': 273}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb02531e8984fd8bb607ca10fca17d8ae359c54', 'x': 960, 'y': 409}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=833fbe7a80fcc400426fa6d728a02864f0de4071', 'x': 1080, 'y': 460}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/7azcqvbb6vo71.png?width=1950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abe93d242d98c6ea028dc39deb0ad1def442b89a', 'x': 1950, 'y': 832}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'u6ib8seu5vo71': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'u6ib8seu5vo71', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f39f058f61ba0d47fb381753aba33a51df495d', 'x': 108, 'y': 60}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6aae883fff66071d46776ef2f64fda770501838', 'x': 216, 'y': 121}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a4db5251d20ebc4608bd8fa2a4ce5a2c47e14ca', 'x': 320, 'y': 180}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=909cb5f69c161f1bb9046f9f7578791962f63b67', 'x': 640, 'y': 360}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cdd2c4541a71c784c1acd4a76e05ab32880a6aa', 'x': 960, 'y': 540}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f9721a037b51c5e26b7d4497ed395f87f312b6', 'x': 1080, 'y': 607}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/u6ib8seu5vo71.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33f7334b9abb0f94f4919327fce0445c2f9ec2a', 'x': 2500, 'y': 1407}, 'status': 'valid'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

2a.) ...But also, the dumpage yesterday could mean a massive rebuy of crypto that could be hiding assets of those that invested in Evergarde. It *could* be a good thing if we see prices in the green today. However, that boils down to money laundering, so if that IS the case, expect a response from the Fed on US soil in a week or 2 clamouring for regulations if this is the case.

3.) The markets will be dumping hard. Stocks, bonds, and crypto to liquidate. It most definitely affects global markets just like the 08 crash did (though not as large). Expect to see drops on futures, and throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Friday might see some corrections from this.

4.) Crypto is going to be liquidated first. Honest truth and a hard truth. It's intangible digital money. And even will all the evidence of ""practical us"", it can't be used for shit and smart economics says ditch it first. Think of how much you buy with actual cryptocurrency (not crypto you converted to cash) and realize this is mostly true.You get your cash assets out of it to bail yourself out of their junk bonds and bad margins. After that, liquidate stocks as well. Same shit.

5.) There could be an impending downturn for major crypto. BTC sub $35k, ETH sub $2200. This shit scares everyone.

6.) Maybe this is all wrong and the crash part happened yesterday and now it's green dildos for the rest of September.

Some of the hedgefunds have been pretty straightforward about how they make their money working off peoples fears.  That the algorithms track peoples emotions based on trading patterns and they use this to manipulate and profit. 

So I guess the secret is to keep a calm mind. Don’t panic, the extreme wealthy don’t and they seem to make money on dips and situations like this.

Presumably, this is also present within El Salvador too, because they are obviously protesting the fact that, as far as they can tell, they have to start adopting it by decree.

The issue with this, is the fact that both mainstream media outlets, the world Bank, the IMF and everyday people seemingly have no idea what legal tender is. Here is an informative piece from everyone's favorite counterfeiting super villain, the Bank of England:

https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-legal-tender

So there you have it. Any vendor has absolutely no legal obligation to accept Bitcoin if they don't want. Vendors don't even have the obligation to accept the national fiat as payment if they don't want. As the BoE points out, a vendor has the right to ask for payment in Pokémon cards if they wish, although not a practical idea for them.

Legal tender definitions and rules have far more nuanced and generally state related purposes than defining the currency a ground of people must or must not accept. It simply states that you cannot be sued for failing to repay a debt should that debt be offered in legal tender. For instance, a government cannot pu 8sh someone for failing to pay tax if they offer to pay tax in a legal tender.

It's worth noting that cheques, debit cards, credit cards, money grams are not considered legal tender, despite the fact that the overwhelming of transactions in a country will take place using them.

Basically, all this fud about the drawbacks of having the uneducated being forced to use technology they don't understand comes from a place of complete misunderstanding of the issue in question.

A lot of people seem to overlook that your choice isn't limited to 2 options: Should I hodl, or sell everything in case we crash?

There are plenty here who aren't troubled by the ups and downs and cooly continue to DCA and hodl. But if you're someone who genuinely feels anxious about the possibility of losing money during a crash and at the same time potentially missing out on big gains by selling too early, your best bet could be to sell

Big Buy: With Monday’s price drop in place, El Salvador reportedly bought 150 Bitcoins at a discounted price.

So often do you hear about people sending crypto to the wrong address with no hope to recover their lost tokens. This is a huge obstacle for adoption imo. I mean even now people make a test transaction to make sure it goes well, which leads extra transaction fees.

As I understand it, every transaction is stored on the blockchain. Shouldn’t it therefore be possible to add a transaction which is designed reverses the previous one (i.e. recover your money). 

The question is whether the recipient should consent to this. I don’t think that is necessary if you introduce a timeline in which this is made possible. 

In addition you could freeze the tokens you sent in the receiving wallet for within the time window you can reverse the transaction.

Another possibility is that both wallet owners must exchange some sort of agreed upon password before a transaction is made. Or that you must type a correct corresponding recipient wallet name (which can be changed anytime at will).

Anyway, I think that inbuilt address checks and/or a possibility to recover lost crypto in faulty transactions would very much encourage adoption.

So, are we heading for 100k?

In the stock market world everyone and their mother was expecting a correction to happen in early-late fall. Well, fall is here and what better way to start the correction with the Evergrande shenanigans. Those hopping for a well defined dip and a V shaped recovery will be disappointed - this will be a slow and gradual process over the coming months. 

Institutions of course will bail crypto first to meet their targets and comply with risk management as retail is hopelessly buying the dip.

Meanwhile vaccines are readily available to anyone who wishes to have one, so don’t expect lockdowns with stimulus dropping from the sky. 

But sir, Plan B and his model?

We had our little - engineered - rally and smart money sold their bags. Remember when BTC was free falling breaking one support level after the other? Well billionaires intervened with their last minute “B Word” conference whose only purpose was to reconcile Elon Musk with the crypto community and stop the free-fall. Meanwhile they shamelessly coordinated the Amazon fake news article the next day of the event and perhaps even invested some of their money to pump the price resulting in the subsequent rally. 

Now, I want you to ask yourselves: if this coordinated by billionaires effort to pump BTC didn’t even break new ATH, do you really think that we will organically reach 100k in 3 months all while the stock market is correcting itself and we are slowly but surely returning to where we were before the the B word conference?

###Introduction    

Ripple is a [real-time gross settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement) system, currency exchange and remittance network created by [Ripple Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_Labs) Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) open source protocol, and supports tokens representing [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.    

In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)).     

###Inception    

Ripple was conceived by [Jed McCaleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_McCaleb) and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz who then approached Ryan Fugger who had debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network. Fugger had developed a system called OpenCoin which would transform into Ripple. The company also created its own form of digital currency referred to as XRP to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait-time.     

###Technology    

Instead of using the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) mining concept, the Ripple network uses a unique distributed [consensus mechanism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp#:~:text=A%20consensus%20mechanism%20is%20a,systems%2C%20such%20as%20with%20cryptocurrencies.) to validate transactions in which participating nodes verify the authenticity of a transaction by conducting a poll. This enables almost instant confirmations without a central authority.     

###Statistics    
(At the time of writing)    

**Price** $0.94   

**Market Cap** $44,341,579,494    

**Circulation** 46.6 Billion    

**Total Supply** 100.0 Billion

Just what BTC needs; association with a dictator!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Bukele is a heavy Twitter user, and after his description changed to  “dictator,” he continued tweeting normally Monday about bitcoin. The  price and potential of the cryptocurrency appears to fascinate Bukele,  and he made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, the first country to do  so. 

Wow!  that is some downplaying.

Kind of like saying:

Just after Hitler declared himself Fuhrer, he continued invading Czechoslovakia.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Last week, thousands of people gathered in El Salvador’s capital for the  first mass march against Bukele, who protesters say has concentrated  too much power, weakened the independence of the courts and may seek  re-election. 

For Bitcoin integration to work, it needs stability.  When you a leader declaring himself a dictator and the people protesting against it, time could be hard in El Salvador for BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Recent public opinion surveys in El Salvador have said a majority of  Salvadorans oppose making the bitcoin an official currency. Still Bukele  says there are now 1.6 million users of the digital payment system in  the Central American nation. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Decentralized**

Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency. So, there is no involvement of third parties. Blockchain technology will manage the database that has the bitcoin transaction records. The decentralization would involve only between the sender and receiver. You don’t have to deal with any third party for your transaction. There is no one to check what you are doing.

**2. Easy &amp; Quick Transactions**

When we exchange cryptocurrency, there is no need for any paperwork or waiting time. You can easily &amp; directly pay cryptocurrency to anyone within a few seconds. There is no involvement of Paperwork, brokerage fee, commission, and any other fees. Also, cryptocurrencies have the lowest transaction fees.

**3. Secure Transaction**

Cryptocurrency is safe &amp; secure. Whenever you do any transaction in cryptocurrency, you cannot reverse it. There will be a strong &amp; secure encryption system used throughout the cryptocurrency transaction process to protect from hackers stealing your information.

**4. Complete Control Over Funds**

Whenever you do any crypto transaction, you have complete control over funds. Every transaction that is performed will be independent of the individuals’ or parties’ identities. It prevents fraud and identity theft from happening.

**5. Be an Early Adopter**

Cryptocurrency is a new &amp; modern currency. Only a few percentages of people know about this and started investing in it. As per financial experts, Cryptocurrency will be the future of payments. Due to its fixed quantity, if you start investing in it. You will earn high returns in a long term.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,3488364,public,self,Why do you need to invest in Cryptocurrency? 5 Strong Reasons,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pshvgu/why_do_you_need_to_invest_in_cryptocurrency_5/,all_ads,6,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Bitcoin blockchain from a pure economic perspective is just a private, secure and inmutable liquidity pool tokenized by btc symbol and collateralized by fiat.

Okay if that is clear let's examine what Evergrande debacle comes from and posible scenarios,

not just Evergrande but all the mayor Chinese companies grow on foreign debit.

major events:

prior to 2007: China fast growing due to good exports bough at debit by EU and USA

2007: Leman Brothers meme (debit bubble crisis). No more x1000 leverage and el cheapo credit but China didn't want to stop double digit grow rates.

2008-2013: China use foreign debit to raise grow and incentivise internal expense, that happen because arbitrage investors take low interest loans fueled by USA FED and use that liquidity to jump into high yield China bonds. Mode info-&gt; ""Quantitative easing 2009"" 

2014: (Tapering) US FED saids no more cheap liquidity. Then China lows the interest rate on popular bank bonds to stimulate their debit.(el cheapo credit for all Chinese people sponsored by China gov)

2020: Corona, China DD  in debit.

2021 Grow rates are not enough to pay debit + House crisis in China(Basically it's the only good they can purchase to invest, that's why bitcoin was so popular there)

Important to remember:

Chinese investors mostly invest in real state (there is common to own 2 or 3 houses and at least 1 house at 25 yo, also it's very difficult there to found a wife if you don't own a house, this is not because they don't know about other stocks but because they can't invest in foreign stocks and they don't trust Chinese companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Posibles outcomes: 

1. Chinese GOV restructures the debit of all zombie companies, and no major economic downturn happen. Chinese investors will learn the lesson and get scare about real state and turns to other investment vehicles difficult to trace for their like cryptos.
2. Chinese GOV can't restructure the debit and stocks panic sell. &lt;- That means free liquidity is going to be up, and as I mention in the top btc is just a private liquidity pool. So an scenario like 2007 free drop(institutional balance account reestructure) and 2008 jump(private investors not trusting FIAT to deposit free liquidity from stocks) could be another scenario.

Massive red candles, orderbook flying, fear amongst the paper hands and blood in the water. This is living!!! Anyway, I'm posting this to hopefully increase your knowledge in the cryptocurrency space and hopefully help you better navigate and play the major crashes. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Let's begin by first breaking the walls of the echo chamber.** What echo chamber you may ask?   
The tiresome mantra - don't leverage, don't short, btc is too volatile, USDC good tether bad, Binance allergies, DCA &amp; HODL only. If you're part of this group, keep reading and I promise you'll learn something and ideally teach you be ahead of the herd that choose to stay fixed in the echo chamber.  


**Key learning 1 - Cryptocurrency market structure**  
From a general macro perspective, there are 3 major cryptocurrency markets - US, EU and APAC (Asia Pacific). Yes amazing, the market is bigger than this reddit sub! Because of this market structure, I encourage you to stay up to date on the macroeconomic events in these respective regions. 

This is because when you have perfect alignment of macroeconomic FUD in the real world, it's going to spill into the cryptocurrency market. Don't believe me? [Here's an article about it discussing the correlation to traditional markets.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/05/13/bitcoin-and-stocks-correlation-reveal-a-secret/) This correlation has only increased further since the articles publishing date due to institutional interest/players and Coinbase IPO. Feel free to do some further reading on this.  


**Key learning 2 - There are multiple factors of market crashes**  
Everyone's talking about Evergrande and attributing this as the sole reason for the market crash. What you need to understand is that there are a number of underlying factors such as the following:

* There are fears in the US about debt limit, stimulus and anticipation of poor job data to be released indicating Delta could be impacting the world more than expected. 
* In the EU, there are issues regarding inflation and gas prices.

In cryptocurrency specifically, here are some factors in market crashes:

* High leverage - not a lot in the system this time around since that got shaken out early sept
* Trading bots - exaggerates price action
* Reflexivity of narratives - market sentiment incredibly bullish or bearish. 

Understand that it's not Evergrande alone that can rock the cryptocurrency market so easily.  
**Key learning 3 - Useful and rubbish TA**  
Let's look at what happened on the weekend prior to the crash - **A FAKE PUMP.** Evergrande &amp; macroeconomic concerns were well-known by late last week. Market manipulators want people to be overly bullish or bearish so will start pushing narratives to trap retail (long or short squeeze). For example, Golden Cross and 300k BTC price calls based on TA. Notice how the golden cross discussions only really started making the rounds after the early september crash?

On another account, I drew the golden cross out first week of August when the MA200 line started curving upwards, no one knew what I was talking about and I got downvoted insanely. I even put comedy as the flair!

Regardless, all of that is rubbish TA is designed to manipulate your sentiment and is generally talked about and propagated by moonbois, youtubers and the average person on this sub. Don't use this sort of TA and take a step back and see how the market is being manipulated. 

*Now that I've shown you what rubbish TA is, here is useful TA i.e. the FAKE PUMP:*

After CME close on Friday, we broke out from a descending channel with NO VOLUME to 48k (0.5 fib) and continued pumping to 49k/towards the golden pocket. A quick sentiment check against moonbois, golden cross narrative etc., it's clearly a setup for a long squeeze and dump when the CME gap closes (I had a small short open at 48k and closed it when CME opened). Hopefully this shows you that useful TA is only part of the puzzle and to be aware of this type of market manipulation.  


[Fake Pump after CME close](https://preview.redd.it/9y982vezbuo71.jpg?width=2998&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab752dedf3c23b090777a611ac7df9b7569510d9)

**Key learning 4 - If you're holding a large long position, learn to hedge with a short position**  
*Disclaimer: I'm not recommending anyone start leverage trading and opening short positions. There are risks involved therefore should be done with applied risk management such as stop losses.*

I like yourself, am holding BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, SOL, LINK, etc. This means I am in long positions, i.e. I only make money when the market goes up. Unfortunately while I want BTC to be $1M tomorrow, markets do move down so it's incredibly useful to know how to capture gains when the market starts moving down, especially when it's a massive and obvious macro-driven move downwards. 

If you were glued to the charts like me yesterday, watching the price action, the speed of the downward price action and the rate of change of the speed of the downward price action, I'd tell you this is the most de-risked time to open a leveraged short. If the movement is large enough, having a short open while simultaneously unwinding long positions enables further de-risking to an overall position. Personally I did not do this because I'm still a bull at this stage and a DeFi native so don't want to unwind my yield farms yet.   


**Key learning 5 - Be interested in what's forbidden by others**  
This flows on from key learning 4. You know those posts with a source from bybt about how people got rekt &amp; liquidated cause they had shorts followed by a bunch of comments going 'leverage trading btc is insane' and circle jerk each other, laughing because people got liquidated? 

99% of the time, they're saying that crap because they have no idea how to apply risk management, how and when to effectively short and how to manage their market exposures. They don't want you to learn so you get ahead of them and find comfort in knowing everyone is just part of the herd like them.

Be curious about what people tell you what not to do. Be curious about what people call a 'shitcoin'. Then understand why, form your own independent opinion and educate others. For some, this may be difficult, it may challenge their understanding and it may make them uncomfortable. **But not you! You're here to make some serious gains and to be a better cryptocurrency investor :)** 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I genuinely hope I've managed to show you something you weren't aware of and helped you be better prepared for the next market crash.**

P.S. Here's my 3 juicy shorts I opened in between my breaks at work yesterday. I also bought up a small $2 ADA bag.

On twitter and other sites you have a lot of Chinese people that left the country, that are anti CCP and that they publish what they see, having a much more bigger interpretation of the market, of the country, of the language.

I then posed a very simple question:

**""Which cryptocurrency should I buy?""**

And here are some of the results:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Think carefully. There's the 20% monthly loss of the bitcoin price, then the 50% collapse of a few other cryptos, and the Cardano rush.

The last one makes no sense and begs the question: who's to say Cardano itself won't implode, too?

But nobody wants to talk about that.

The common theme for analysts these days is that they just don't see the bottom. They're clearly stumped, which has led many to assume Bitcoin will hit $500,000 and Ethereum $9,000 soon.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elon Musk gave his thoughts earlier this year. ""Bitcoin could be $100,000 before Christmas and Ethereum $10,000 before 2022. Good times,"" he said. That's a lot of demand for an unregulated asset, especially one that is incredibly volatile in the coming months.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available on the market but only a few are profitable in nature. Some of the very successful cryptocurrencies are – Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Algorand (ALGO), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL).

However, be careful not to buy these cryptocurrencies as they may end up in big losses.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cryptocurrencies are only available to people who have the technical ability to understand the code behind the company, their regulations, the business model, and technical standards. Be careful because many of us do not know anything.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies, the best advice you can take is to do your own research.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be clear, buying and holding cryptocurrency is not quite the same thing as getting rich quick. Even some of the most lucrative cryptocurrencies go through significant booms and busts.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are too many options, so I've tried to compile a basic list of the most popular cryptocurrencies that I believe are the best options for average everyday users.

So, my initial set of rules are:

A token can be worth 1 cent or $300. The total supply is less than 1 billion. A token should be available for use as a currency or a store of value in some economy with a market cap between $10 and $1,000 billion. A token must have a technology that promises some kind of utility. It doesn't have to be instant, but something that you can use reliably.

The only rule I have to justify the 1 cent coin is that it has to not be worthless. In all other ways, it's worthless.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing to do is to consider your age, the nature of your investing, the amount of risk you want to take, and the portfolio you want to build.

If you're a 30-year-old, you should be a little more adventurous. I would probably recommend Ethereum to this investor, given it's been riding high lately, and there is a growing community behind it. If you are a lot younger and don't mind taking on more risk, you might be best looking at Tether.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buy anything but dollar cost average in.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitcoin: If you want a 'pure' cryptocurrency with no management or middle men involved, Bitcoin is the obvious choice. It is also the most well-known of the bunch, and carries the most fundamental 'secure' aspect of any currency. However, it has also been known to plunge sharply in value, sometimes pretty dramatically, in relation to other cryptocurrencies if you buy and hold.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most investors interested in cryptocurrencies are generally divided into two camps: long-term HODLers and traders. Long-term investors are looking for long-term gains, and they're comfortable owning a basket of crypto assets for the long term.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, my current focus is to buy Bitcoin and I’m very much an early adopter with $1,000+ worth of the cryptocurrency already.

The best strategy is to buy at a good price and go against the herd. That means you need to be careful when buying, and can only have it as an investment for the long term.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Surprisingly, there's some solid advice sprinkled in here.**

Most importantly: if you're particularly young, invest in Tether.

Blockchain is a distributed public ledger that records cryptocurrencies transactions. The maintenance of this blockchain ledger is performed by a network of communicating nodes running same version of blockchain software. Every digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin or any other has its own blockchain software platform, a ledger and a community of miners.

In the last 10 years or so, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology has overcome all blockades in its way, destroying all kinds of myths and cynicism. Passionate followers have not only adopted these digital currencies but they have been fast enough to update themselves with this ever changing technology. With total crypto marketcap at $500+ billions, millions of transactions are executed each day as blockchain technology is being adopted by top level companies. Therefore, in this fast changing world it would be worth knowing, how to store and secure your precious Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies using digital wallets.

## What is a Digital Wallet?

Similar to fiat currencies, digital currencies need to be managed and stored somewhere. As we keep dollar bills securely in a wallet so do we need to store our digital currencies like Bitcoin in wallets.

A digital wallet refers to a smart electronic device or a software program that allows an individual to make electronic transactions online. This can include sending-receiving digital currencies or purchasing items with a computer, tablet, smartphone or any other smart device. A digital wallet uses software for proving authenticity of device/user, based on information stored in device itself. So a digital wallet has both a software and information component inside it. The software in combination with information like password, pin or a master key provides required minimal security and encryption for online transactions. There are two types of digital wallets available in the market: One is operated at client side or user side, where private keys are stored on user device itself. Another type of digital wallet can be maintained at server side and private keys are usually stored on the service provider server or exchange. The latter one is slightly easier to operate for end user as most of the setup hassle is handled by the exchange. Let us explore these digital wallets further.

#### Crypto Wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins, basically, a master key (private key to be more specific). These are special digital wallets used to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin etc and sometimes also called as Crypto Wallets. Like normal wallets, one can add, send or receive digital currencies from crypto wallets using private keys. These private keys/master keys are generated using strong cryptographic algorithms. This master key is used to authenticate a device/person identity to a wallet system. Once user identity is verified only then can someone make crypto transactions. Usually private keys are made up of alphanumeric strings of different lengths. A cryptocurrency wallet stores public and private key combination, which can be used to buy or send the cryptocurrency from your address to new address. A wallet can contain multiple pairs of public and private keys.

#### How Does it Actually Works?

Cryptocurrency transactions work much like a traditional banking system and needs to trust on third party service providers usually a cryptocurrency exchange or a miner, in case you are not running a full node. This third party exchange/miner keeps record of all cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain, acting as a fully functional digital ledger. These service providers have huge computation power and charge a nominal fee for operational cost coverage.

Unlike banking systems these crypto systems are decentralized and all work in a democratic way, by majority agreement. Service providers usually link the individual wallet to their core wallet. So just like with a bank for debit or credit card, the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Even though crypto wallets are extremely safe, sometimes due to poor management of private keys by exchanges, hackers can trick system to steal user’s cryptocurrencies. This happened in the case of Mt. Gox exchange hacking in Japan, where exchange lost most of their clients’ bitcoins in a single hack incident.

Similar to how bank allocates a unique savings account number to a user, crypto exchanges assign a unique Digital Address (an alphanumeric string) and a unique Private Key to a user. This crypto address is just like your bank account number and can be shared publicly without any concerns of hacking. Only a person having access to private key of a digital address can view and operate transactions from that account. Private key is used for authentication during sending and receiving bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. On the other hand, access to the receiving wallet is not required for sending any cryptocurrency. Sender only needs to know the destination address and anyone can send cryptocurrency to that address.

If the private key of a crypto wallet is not compromised/leaked then it is almost impossible to break into your digital account. Its a well known fact that National Security Agency (NSA) of USA, has the highest computational power on earth. It is mathematically calculated that if all of NSA computational power is used even then it may take years to break into your digital account with brute force hacking method. These systems are so secure that if you forgot or lose the secret private key for your account then your bitcoins and cryptos are lost forever.

At present, there are four varieties of cryptocurrecy wallets widely in use.

#### Web Wallet:

A web wallet is a web based service that allows users to store and control their private keys and other useful information at a service provider server. All crypto transactions are performed by using any standard web browser like Google Chrome. While using a web wallet user private keys are managed by a third party provider. Due to several Bitcoin and other crypto hacking incidents several exchanges have started providing two-factor-authentication (2FA) feature to their customers.

A common example of a web wallet is MyEtherWallet (MEW). One can further visit https://www.myetherwallet.com/ to know more about how this web wallet works. The most important thing to remember is, user should always make sure whether they are using the right URL/website and if the entire communication from your browser to server is encrypted using “https” protocol. If a website is not starting with https, always avoid it to create any accounts or send and receive any crypto currencies.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost.  
No need to carry an extra device while you are travelling or outside home.

**Cons:**  
Unsafe as hackers and keyloggers can hack your account and steal your funds.  
Difficult to transact on a public wifi.

#### Software Wallet:

A software wallet is like any desktop application installed locally on your computer, or a mobile app installed on your Android or iOS based smart devices. For example, ImToken Mobile Wallet app is installed and used as we use any other app from Google Play or iPhone App stores. IMtoken is among the best software wallets with ample features supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. However, all software wallets might have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be used by hackers to perform illegal transactions from your digital wallet. With software wallet you have the option of using the same private key for your software wallet as well as web wallet. But for all cases securing your private key is utmost important.  
IMtoken is downloadable on both Android and iOS.

**Pros:**  
Easy to use.  
No additional cost as most apps are freely available.  
Much more secure than Web Wallet.

**Cons:**  
Require regular software updates with product version releases.  
For security reasons a user needs to remove all data related to app when changing or selling the device.

#### Paper Wallet:

Paper wallets are yet another kind of wallets used for cryptocurrencies management. Individuals can print their digital addresses and private keys in the form of a QR code on a piece of paper. This piece of paper acts as a physical wallet and should be always kept at a safe place. Actually, it provides pretty good security as private key is stored offline and not vulnerable to hacking. However, this advantage is only applicable till private key is on paper. Once you enter the private key in a wallet to operate your transaction then it is equally vulnerable as is your underlying OS and software. Infact, there is additional hassle of entering private key again and again. Although one can use barcode reader but that again leaves a loophole in the safe operation of private key.

**Pros:**  
Easy to store and can be kept in a cupboard or a physical safe.  
Since it is stored offline its always protected from hackers.  
Its portable as it is much easy to carry paper and can be kept in a normal fiat wallet.

**Cons:**  
Can be easily destroyed intentionally or unintentionally.

#### Hardware Wallet:

These days our computers and smart devices are always connected with internet. Each device usually have multiple apps, web browsers and softwares. These web browsers and apps can have known or unknown vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited by a seasoned hacker. Moreover, it was found from a survey that end users tend to ignore regular software updates, posing great risk to their device and investments. Its a possibility that private keys on an internet connected device are compromised. These are some of the loopholes exploited by hackers during several Bitcoin and other high value cryptocurrencies hacks.

Hardware wallet is the best existing solution to all of these hacking concerns, as user private key is never shared with anyone and never leaves the hardware device. When a hardware wallet performs a transaction, wallet’s software creates an encrypted value from the private key. This encrypted value is then shared with the remote device (or exchange) to complete authentication of the transaction. This way hardware wallet provides the best security among all digital wallets.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the best hardware wallet companies with a variety of products with different safety features. Both companies have created devices that require user to physically enter a pin by pressing button on the device to finally trigger the transaction. Some hardware wallets also have addition layer of security where user is required to enter a secret pin to open the hardware wallet. All these new safety devices and features have forced hackers to burn more midnight oil. If a user is taking all precautions then it is almost impossible to hack such devices by anyone.

**Pros:**  
Extremely secure as private keys are never exposed.  
Since it is a stand alone, separate device chances of virus infection are minimal.  
Devices have additional layer of security possible like pressing a button or pin entry.  
You can do transactions safely even on public wifi networks.  
Can be used for multiple cryptocurrencies.

**Cons:**  
Usually hardware wallets are expensive. A good hardware wallet can easily cost $100 plus.

If this isn't the right place to ask these questions, can someone point me in the right direction?

My father decided to invest in crypto in early August. His initial investment was $300. His thought was if he lost it all, it was only $300. 

I found out last night that he's invested approximately $100,000 now. He decided to cash out (is that the right term?) a few weeks ago with three currencies totaling around $400,000 USD.

He's been dealing with Coinberry. I checked last night and thank god, the emails are actually from @coinberry.com. I looked at some reviews and it seems like Coinberry is on the up and up. However, they've been using his money to invest through an off-shore company called ATBCrypto. Everything I've read about them suggests that while ATBCrypto isn't necessarily a scam company, it might be a headache to get his money from him.

At this point it sounds like these three currencies have been cashed out or whatever, and it's actual liquid money. In order to have the money transferred to him, Coinberry is telling him that he has to pay their commission charge first. This is what sounds sketchy to me. Can they not collect the money from ATBCrypto and take their cut from that? Their commission fee is $30,000-$40,000, and although he can probably scrape the money together to pay them, I don't him to potentially get scammed for more.

He's expecting a call from the person he's been dealing with at Coinberry this afternoon. I'm going to be on the call if I can. Is there anything I should be asking? Anything I should listen for that would indicate he's being scammed?

Again, sorry if this isn't the place to be asking these questions, and sorry if I'm rambling and not making sense.

Your total investment is now 2K. **If Bitcoin goes back to 12K you double your second 1k and you have 20% of the 1k you put in first, which makes your total worth now 2,2k and you're in profit.** This means you don't need insane percentages to break even, just don't sell and buy the dip.

That’s because we are so early most individuals you try to explain crypto to don’t understand it.

Now 2 days ago I made a post about how to watch out for the stock market to dictate the direction of Crypto.

Today I'm here to teach you a little bit on TA and give you some advice, all this for free. You don't have to use it if you already have your own strategies, this is for the majority who don't have a clue what the fuck they are doing. So I will keep it simple.

In todays lessons there are 3 tips. Go to Google after and ead up on the subjects if you want to EDUCATE yourself and EVOLVE (thoses are shocking words I know)

1. Learn how to read the candlesticks on the charts, and price movements. 4 main important concepts : Support, Resistance, Higher High and Higher Low, Lower High and Lower Low, oh and Fakeouts.

2. Use the RSI and learn to zoom in and zoom out on the charts, like 1h, 4h, daily, weekly... RSI can do wonders.

3. Be PATIENT and have a strategy. If your goal is to hold and be rich, then do that but don't cry when it goes down. If you are in but are in profits and don't know what to do, next time you can take out 20% for example (or whateversuits your game). Also, don't regret taking profit and ""I could have made more"". You won some, you could have made more if you invested when you were 2 years old, but you didn't.

That's it.

Hope that can help give a little direction to some, good luck out there it's crazy world.

Have you heard of saitama coin ?
If you answered no please do some research and don’t miss out. 
If you answered yes then I know you’ll be hodling some. 

What is saitama!

Saitama is a newish token that is still at a low entry point. 

They have created a app called saitamask which is a 1 stop app for purchases swaps etc. 

They also have a game releasing on that same app called wolfcaster 

They have partnered up with the HALL OF FAMERS NBA and also espn are partnering up with them. Also they are releasing Saitamask at the MGM VEGAS 14th November. This is massive 

My experience so far I bought 25bil at £18 that same 25bil is now £120+ also every day is breaking ATH’s and doesn’t loose momentum as whales sell as a anti whale contracts are in place. Also a 2%burn and 2%distribution on every purchase sell.

There are numerous ways to generate passive income without having to trade or in some cases even invest anything.

Cryptocurrency Credit Cards seem to be the new thing. The rewards for all crypto cards are exponentially better than traditional finance cards for which you usually even have to pay a fee to use.

# Cashback Rewards

This is where PLUTUS and the PLU token come in. PLUTUS offers cashback deals of a current minimum of 3% with some rewards reaching up to 15% for certain retailers. Most importantly these are not only small time companies that you can get cashback from, in fact big companies such as NIKE APPLE LENOVO AMAZON LOGITECH and many more are included within the list.

# Non-Custodial Decentralised Staking

Other than the amazing rewards offered by the card another thing that puts this card in first place when it comes to crypto cards is that it offers decentralised staking. What this means is that your funds (both the funds you stake and those you use to buy goods) are stored on the wallet of your choice such as METAMASK. This means that you are in full control of your wallet, unlike the other cards for which you have to keep your funds on the platform of the cards company itself.

# Tokenomics

Tokenomics of the project are very reasonable and aimed for a long term future. A max supply of 20m PLU with the remaining 17.15m PLU reserved for the PLU Reward System, the source of the 3% PLU Cashback rewards. The emission rate is variable depending on the volume of the PlutusDEX.

Furthermore, to facilitate long term healthy growth the PLU reward rate is deflationary, meaning as usage grows, the rate at which PLU is emitted decreases. This model ensures scarcity while making it even more profitable for early adopters.

As the volume of the PlutusDEX remains 30BTC or less, the reward rate will always be 3%. Following that, every increase of 0.1BTC results in a 0.0165% reduction in the reward rate up to a minimum rate of 1%.

# Team and Community

PLUTUS as a company has a long way to grow it is relatively new both in marketcap and age and they are definitely doing all things right. Constantly developing their platform to the needs of their customers. Very high community engagement and excellent customer service with several rewards being shared other than their staking rewards and cashback.
