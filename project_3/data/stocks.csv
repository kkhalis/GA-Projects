Chinese Estates Holdings, the second-biggest shareholder of embattled developer China Evergrande, has said that it has sold $32 million worth of its Evergrande stake and plans to exit the holding completely.

""The directors are cautious and concerned about the recent development of China Evergrande Group including certain disclosure made by China Evergrande Group on its liquidity,"" Chinese Estates said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

With $305 billion in liabilities, Evergrande is struggling to meet its debt obligations and investors worry that the rot could spread to creditors including banks in China and abroad.

Shares of Chinese Estates jumped as much as 15.1 percent in early trading to HK$2.51, notching the biggest daily percentage gain since June 2020.

China Evergrande stock soared as much as 32 percent in the biggest daily percentage rise since listing in November 2009, after its unit said on Wednesday it had ""resolved"" a coupon payment on an onshore bond.

Chinese Estates, which owned about 6.5 percent of Evergrande's equity capital as of September 10 according to Refinitiv Eikon data, said it has mandated a sale of all or part of the remaining 5.66 percent Evergrande stake either on the market or through block trades.

The disposal mandate will be valid for 12 months from the date of a shareholders' meeting on Sept. 23 to approve the sale, it said.

Chinese Estates said it had already sold 108.91 million shares, or 0.82 percent, of Evergrande's issued share capital between Aug. 30 and Sept. 21 for HK$246.5 million ($32 million).

The company estimated that if the entire stake is sold, it will realise a loss of about HK$9,486.3 million ($1.22 billion) for the year ending in December 2021.

Proceeds from the disposals will be used for general working capital and for reinvestment when opportunities arise, it added.

# September 19-25, 1921

This week, the Fed lowers rates to 5%, and the WSJ editors bravely declare the Dow has bottomed.

&gt;**Quick Stats:**  
*DJIA: 69.43 (Today: 34,584)*  
*Shiller PE Ratio: 5.4 (Today: 38.3)*  
*Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 5.0% (Today: 0.25%)*  
*GBPUSD: $3.71 (Today: $1.37)*  
*Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $4.00)*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Market-Moving Themes:**  
Sentiment remains lukewarm towards stocks despite the perfect setup (equity, debt markets)  
As wartime raw material shortages ease, relative price stability reigns (commodity markets)  
German war reparations causing strong dollar (currency markets)

**Executive Summary:**

* On September 19, the WSJ editors bravely declare that âthere is a bull market impending in stocksâ and the August low was the finale to the 1919-1921 bear market. This masterful front page news piece walks through how National City Bank (today known as Citigroup) and The New York Times believe the current bounce in the market is a âfalse boom,â yet these same characters were so wrong in November 1919 when the market turned south. Writers go on to say that the current bear established itself when things looked impossibly good. The reverse is now true today.
* The broad equity and debt markets in New York and London may be dull, but thereâs always a bull market somewhere. The trading action over the past month has been in Germany. On Monday, pit traders illustrate the view from the German bourse. Speculation runs rampant. Banned from owning dollars, the public want to move their wealth out of marks. To where? Stocks. Equities are going gangbusters, with coal and iron companies bid up. Areas where desks previously rested are now in storage to make room for people.  

   * **Historical Fact:** In the early phase of the Weimar Republicâs inflationary saga, the equity market preserved purchasing power. As we get closer to the middle of 1922, hyperinflation will wipe out equities, debt, and currency holders leaving real estate as the sole wealth preserver. Too little or too much inflation damages any economy.
* The Federal Reserve of New York lowers rates from 5.5% to 5% on September 21. The rest of the Fed branches match in tandem. The powerful New York Federal Reserve President (Governor pre-1935), Benjamin Strong, delivers a terse statement to the Journal. Equities seem nonplussed and drop the next day. The aggregate yield on high quality debt rallies from 4.8% to 4.5%.
* A special ""Sequence of Crisis"" report out of Amsterdam on Saturday. Such heavy hitters as Royal Dutch and Heineken were considered high-class securities only months ago. What has transpired is a terrible blow for investors and speculators alike, who had bought these shares never expecting a catastrophe. Perception is stronger than reality, and nobody cares about business improvements over the past couple months. Depression haunts the trading hours.
* Although the first reparation committee convened nearly two years ago, Britain, Belgium and France still canât agree on their share of German payment. All of these countries remain heavily indebted to the US, and quick goals of extinguishing war debts vanish with yet new meetings to solve this quarrel. The article mentions that the US is not pressing claims, and will not push any of the Allied countries into bankruptcy as long as it âreceives its share of the fruits of victory.â",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3062082,public,self,I'm reading the FT and WSJ from 100 years ago each week leading to 1929,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ptud65/im_reading_the_ft_and_wsj_from_100_years_ago_each/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'z9L5Jn5KLUVPyLSqzknz36i9_HQGh993GEgxqUGvyM4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3Ln6wd3HJMsTnJI_KwsjQdS7JsM21whfnXKVhNsuAIM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc86cd97a5a51e497b08a96b9066d1077243064c', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3Ln6wd3HJMsTnJI_KwsjQdS7JsM21whfnXKVhNsuAIM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70dc8e330c2230be8260320ea1571d52bda996e9', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 256, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3Ln6wd3HJMsTnJI_KwsjQdS7JsM21whfnXKVhNsuAIM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=36ec510e86b3521a785a610dc1d1f665b16ba69d', 'width': 256}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

Chinese authorities are asking local governments to prepare for the potential downfall of China Evergrande Group, according to officials familiar with the discussions, signaling a reluctance to bail out the debt-saddled property developer while bracing for any economic and social fallout from the companyâs travails.

The officials characterized the actions being ordered as âgetting ready for the possible storm,â saying that local-level government agencies and state-owned enterprises have been instructed to step in only at the last minute should Evergrande 3333, +17.62% fail to manage its affairs in an orderly fashion.

I got[ Lithium Corporation](https://www.lithiumcorporation.com/) ($LTUM) because I think there is probably a better return on energy metals in the future. ie lithium, cobalt, graphite, etc. in my perspective.

Also got some from[ Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) ([CNL.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/)). The announcement from last month detailed results about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling and they already started drilling last week. Their cash burn is also impressively low, making the company set for a long timeline. There is a possibility that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than the previous discovery, since they recently announced a potential gold porphyry stockwork system at their Victory target area.

I know itâs kind of risky investing on these but I believe itâs a high-risk high-reward thing. They entail higher risk but we cannot ignore their strong profit potential especially with those who already started drilling and are showing great promise.

(Yicai Global) Sept. 22 -- Luckin Coffeeâs shares rose after the Chinese coffee store chain, which was fined USD180 million by US regulators in December for faking sales, said it had settled a USD187 million class action lawsuit and returned to normal financial reporting.

Luckin Coffee \[OTCMKTS: LKNCY\], whose stock trades on the over-the-counter market in New York, was up 0.2 percent at USD15.08 as of 9 p.m. local time, after gaining 3.4 percent yesterday. The shares are still 70 percent below a January 2020 peak.

The Xiamen-based company has agreed a deal with the lead plaintiffs to fully resolve all claims that have been or could be filed on behalf of a class of purchasers of its American depository shares from May 17, 2019 through July 15, 2020, it said in an annual earnings report published yesterday.

âThis settlement will resolve a significant contingent liability and enable Luckin Coffee to move forward with a greater focus on our operations and the execution of our strategic plan,â Chief Executive Guo Jinyi said. âWe are working diligently to enter into formal settlement agreements and obtain necessary court approvals.â

Luckin Coffee was brought low by a short sellerâs report in January 2020 that accused it of fraud. The firm has since confessed to inflating its 2019 revenue by as much as CNY2.12 billion and its costs and expenses by CNY1.34 billion. It was expelled from the Nasdaq in June last year, ending a 400-day listing.

The class action settlement will be calculated based on a global settlement amount of USD187.5 million, which will be reduced on a pro-rata basis based on the valid opt-out notices received pursuant to the US courtâs prior order approving dissemination of a notice of pendency, according to its financial report.

Revenue jumped 33 percent to CNY4.03 billion (USD618.1 million) last year as Luckin Coffee raised its prices and despite the Covid-19 pandemic and restructuring, the report showed.

Operating expenses stood at CNY6.6 billion, in line with Luckin Coffeeâs business expansion, and included CNY475.3 million in losses and expenses related to investigations and restructuring caused by the accounting scandal. The firm did not mention net losses.

In China at the end of last year, Luckin Coffee had 3,929 own stores in 56 cities and 874 partnership outlets. It also had about 9.8 percent more transacting customers at 64.9 million.

I have found very promising strategy for trading.
and half a year ago interviewed 70 people and formed team of 6 members.

(We all share the same reward &amp; we are good friends now, although we never met in person).

Firstly, we built our MVP bot in Python - which was able to send us signals via telegram &amp; also execute them in our trading account.

Results and manual backtests were promising, so we decided to rebuild the bot in C++, this time it will be much faster and more reliable &amp; we will link it to MT5 platform and take care about all problems that we have recignized in 6 months time.

We will also use the bot for backtesting. 

Now, we decided that we might include 1 new member in our team who is software developer knowledgeable in C++, understands the financial markets &amp; trading; and what is the most important good in heart!

They can range from any time in your life when you were exposed to the market, be it as a child who knew nothing to an adult who was researching it hoping to invest or trade.

Iâll start with a few of mine from when I was a child.

- In Chinese, âstockâ is âgÇ piÃ oâ (literally: âstock-share ticketâ). However, the first character is pronounced exactly as the same as the term for âdrumâ (âgÇ,â although the written character is different). When I first learned about the market in Chinese, I kept thinking it meant âdrum ticketâ and used my own wild imaginations to picture what such a thing would look like.

- The first time I heard âDow Jones,â I thought it was âDown Jonesâ and immediately jumped to the conclusion that the market must be called âUp Jonesâ on days when it went up. When âUp Jonesâ never appeared, I wondered why people would keep calling it âDown Jonesâ when the price clearly was going up.

- The first time I watched business news covering the market (pre-Internet days), I had no idea what was causing these stock prices to go up or down. I just thought all these companies were scoring points in some kind of game, so I kept waiting for the toy companies to show up just to see their scores.

My investment in them is up 35% as of today. And I am looking to hold them for at least 5 more years, and most likely longer.

It's hard to say what they do, but here are some things:

* Billboard rentals (yes billboards)
* Broadband services
* Insurance commissions

BOMN recently released earnings and everything is up. Billboard rentals account for 56% of their business and that revenue was up. Broadband revenue tripled year-over-year. Broadband is a business sector they are going to build out and one of their most recent acquisitions was in December of last year. I suspect we'll see revenue from this sector grow significantly. They are seeing 85% gross margins in their broadband services revenue.

Their book value grow 28% in the last 6 months. Before a deal they announced in August (yellowstone acquisition company).

They have around $57 million in cash and over $100 million in treasuries. So plenty of money to invest in companies and increase value to shareholders like me. Also, operating cash flow is up.

The stock closed up near 12% today (9/22).

(Reuters) -Canada's BlackBerry Ltd beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday as hybrid working trends drove demand for its cybersecurity and Internet of Things software products.

Firms such as BlackBerry are benefiting from an uptick in demand for cybersecurity and IoT products as more businesses and government organizations shift their operations to the cloud in order to support hybrid working.

As a result, the company was able to offset weakness from sluggish demand for its QNX software from automakers like Volkswagen, BMW and Ford Motor, as the auto industry struggled to keep up production amid a persistent chip shortage crisis.

Revenue fell to $175 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31, from $259 million a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $163.5 million in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 22, 2021**

The market bounced today, breaking on the yearâs longest streak of underperformance as Evergrande fears in the US ease and market participants digest commentary from the Federal Reserveâs September monetary policy meeting, which indicated the central bank will likely start tapering the pace of quantitative easing in the âcoming meetingsâ and telegraphed interest rate hikes six or seven times by the end of 2024. As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed begins raising the interest rate sometime in the coming 1-2 years. Glad to see the market avoid a taper tantrum today. 

([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)). 

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has previously communicated to the market that the timing of a so-called taper âwill not be intended to carry a direct signalâ on the timing of eventual rate hikes. 

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. But Fed officials have said in recent weeks that by the end of the year, the economy will likely make the âsubstantial further progressâ indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

The Fed signaled, âParticipants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriateâ. 

In other news, during remarks following the release of the the meeting, Powell promised to make changes to the central bankâs rules on members trading securities. e added that he was not aware of the controversial trades made by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in 2020 prior to media reports over the past month.

âWe understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And thatâs why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,â he said.

&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials signaled they would probably begin tapering their bond-buying program soon and revealed a growing inclination to start raising interest rates in 2022.  
&gt;  
&gt;If progress toward the Fedâs employment and inflation goals âcontinues broadly as expected, the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,â the U.S. central bankâs policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a statement following a two-day meeting.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed also published updated quarterly projections which showed officials are now evenly split on whether or not it will be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate as soon as next year, according to the median estimate of FOMC participants. In June, the median projection indicated no rate increases until 2023.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a virtual press conference at 2:30 p.m. in Washington to discuss the U.S. central bankâs first steps toward withdrawing emergency pandemic support for the economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;His performance will be parsed both by investors and the White House: The central bank chiefâs term expires in February and President Joe Biden is expected to decide this fall whether or not to renominate him to another four years in his post.  
&gt;  
&gt;âweâre seeing a Fed that is getting more hawkish,â Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television after the statement was published.  
&gt;  
&gt;U.S. stocks rose slightly, while yields on 10-year Treasuries maintained an earlier decline. The dollar remained lower after the decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;New Projections  
&gt;  
&gt;The FOMC decided to maintain the target range for its benchmark policy rate at zero to 0.25%, and continue purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $120 billion per month. The vote was unanimous.  
&gt;  
&gt;Projections for 2024 were also published for the first time, with the median suggesting a federal funds rate of 1.8% by the end of that year. The median for 2023 rose to 1%, from 0.6% in the June projection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other Forecast Takeaways (median estimate):  
&gt;  
&gt;FOMC median projection for 2022 inflation rose to 2.2% from 2.1% in June; held the 2023 forecast at 2.2%  
&gt;  
&gt;Unemployment 3.8% 2022, 3.5% 2023; no change from June forecast  
&gt;  
&gt;GDP growth seen at 3.8% in 2022, 2.5% in 2023, both higher than the prior projections  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed also said it would double the per-counterparty limit on its overnight reverse-repurchase agreement facility to $160 billion daily.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, well below the April 2020 peak of 14.8%. But itâs still above the 3.5% rate that prevailed in February 2020, just before the pandemic struck. Fed officials have said they expect to keep the funds rate near zero âuntil labor-market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committeeâs assessments of maximum employment.â  
&gt;  
&gt;Inflation, according to the Fedâs preferred measure, was 4.2% in the 12 months through July, well above the central bankâs 2% target. Many Fed officials have said they expect it to return to around 2% after temporary supply-chain disruptions resulting from the pandemic have been resolved, though several have also cited the rapid price increases as a reason to begin raising rates as early as next year.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3060479,public,self,"Fed Signals Bond-Buying Taper May Start Soon, Split on 2022 Hike",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ptdq5a/fed_signals_bondbuying_taper_may_start_soon_split/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'vAcmVojr3o3aiEikdZ2UgN9KHfSEWAzEDp-bTPCMuWo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14abe7bf65750205b0da15a979a30cb991696d3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f5485284d54edd17b38d78e31fa22c58aeb076', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc900a91a29e9bc138188077999c01fc71ccadbe', 'width': 320}, {'height': 427, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d8828901a3aab32955165712a456307a660538e', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b756bf28efd73f24533f9313b7602f5354a82da9', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3d05ed5830a67567f7bdf323c90b98746f348c5', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/vIe-D48psPemW0ZJ-Mq8QO0-p9Wk0ILfUi3_3KcTkLQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=36708d14a93acaef5fef74071b41f85ec8918f6e', 'width': 1199}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

&gt;
&gt;State-owned enterprises will underpin the restructure, effectively transforming the property developer into a state-owned enterprise.
&gt;
&gt;âThe deal is being designed to protect Chinese nationals who have bought apartments from Evergrande, like the ones you see protesting on the streets and also those who have invested in Evergrandeâs wealth management products,â the source said.
&gt;
&gt;âBut the big thing is stemming any widespread economic flow-on effects that insolvency would cause on the China economy.â
&gt;
&gt;Talk of a Government-led restructure comes as the Thursday (September 23) deadline looms for a $83.5 million interest payment on a 5-year, USD denominated Evergrande bond. The bondâs initial issue size was around $2 billion.
&gt;
&gt;The bondâs covenants have a 30-day period before a missed payment is considered a default.
&gt;
&gt;On the same day, Evergrande also has to pay a $35.8 million coupon payment for a Shenzhen-traded 5.8% Sept 2025 bond. The companyâs Hengda Real Estate unit has today said it will make that payment, but not word thus far on the USD bond commitments.
&gt;
&gt;Another multi-million dollar interest payment on a 7-year USD bond is due the following week.

No? That is why I am long Robinhood. $HOOD

The app is incredible and constantly getting better. Have you seen the new graphics for portfolios? Have you seen the P&amp;L graphics for options? They are educating the retail investor and the newcomer, which is a very impressionable audience.

The branding is amazing. There is not a better banking brand than Robinhood. The idea of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is a very embraced idea. People are going to quickly forget the T-2 issues that were caused by archaic clearing house rules. Like I stated earlier, people donât remember that Mercedes made tanks for the Nazis, they arenât going to care about the smear that happened earlier this year.

They are embracing Digital Currency Wallets and the future metaverse. They plan on competing with Coinbase and all of the other wallets. They are excellent teachers and will teach digital currencies to the masses just like they have taught many how to trade. The retail trader is the future and Robinhood is best poised for that market as they have done a fantastic job bringing a product that makes trading understandable to the masses. Iâve introduced serval friends to trading and they pick the $HOOD app over the others every time.

Donât forget they revolutionized trading! THEY single handedly brought trading fees to 0. THEY are the original anti-banking banking company. THEY will win over the majority of future retail traders.

* Both have very similar revenue growth, ie they aren't usurping each others' market share

* $CAT's dividend yield is double that of $DE, as is the payout ratio ($CAT's is over 50%)
* $DE has a beta slightly &gt; 1, while $CAT's is &lt; 1

The above factors lead me to believe $DE has the capacity to continue to invest in growth, while $CAT is almost fully focused on dividend payouts. 

My goal with this position would be to diversify my portfolio and reap some dividends to reinvest. I am young (21), and my portfolio is currently very tech- and growth-heavy. My initial thoughts are that $DE is the better pick for me, since it will have time to grow its market cap and profits, and potentially yield higher dividends in the future while still riding out prevailing market trends.

Add away!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Know  your handle from your gross and net gaming revenue. Sportsbooks may  dazzle you with handle, but the bottom line figure of gross or net  gaming revenue is their traditional ""revenue"". Handle includes free bets  which don't lead to eventual EBITDA.  [See here Indiana's handle increased 11% but their gaming revenue decreased 5%](https://www.gambling.com/news/us/indiana-august-sports-betting-handle-up-11-posts-215-6m-2655900)
2. Future  seasons and competitions of sports are baked into revenue projections.  We often see ""NFL season will be huge!"" or ""NBA games have been on the  edge"". All revised guidance takes into account seasons about to start or  even big competitions like the World Cup.
3. Be  wary of the legalization landscape trap. We often hear ""wait til  California, Florida and Texas legalize"". Revenue is going to double.  First, this could be years off. Second, the revenue won't drip uniformly  to each provider with some state lotteries getting the bulk. If it was  that easy, DKNG would be at $100 already. We're bullish but this is a  long road.
4. While operators such as PENN (Barstools), DKNG and Fanduel try to differentiate themselves, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DKNG/comments/peimu7/copy_paste/) proves that most sportbetting stocks move in unison (with selected over performers). Credit to [u/No\_Ordinary\_9661](https://www.reddit.com/u/No_Ordinary_9661/) for the post. Buy the sector not a stock. [Invest in BETZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p41n1y/betz_sports_betting_etf_a_closer_look/)
5. Sportsbetting stocks are not a hedge against the market. Gambling stocks move up and down sometimes with - and sometimes - against the market. If  gambling legalization will be favorable, total-spend up and we see new  customers on the horizon, buy. If we see lack of legalization, bans and  gamblers turning to fantasy NFTs or another, sell.
6. A  sports data provider such as SRAD/Sportradar makes it profits as a B2B  business but slowly these companies are becoming B2C since 22% of their  revenue is from gross gaming revenue of the sportsbooks (according to  filings). The more sportsbooks there are, the more fees and % they will  get. These companies trade at a premium in terms of EV/Revenue as they  have larger barriers to entry and often are profit-making already.
7. AI  is a big deal in sportsbetting. The tech allows a company to increase  customer spending, restrict/block winning customers and offer customized  products per region. Look for companies investing heavily in AI.
8. M&amp;A  is trending in sportsbetting stocks (think DKNG/Golden  Nugget/Entain(!!), PENN/The Score) as the cost of customer acquisition  has soared and buying existing customers is the low hanging fruit.  Companies which can make M&amp;A value-adds and acquire new gamblers are  going to make it.
9. Don't  forget about sportsbetting stocks over in Europe. FLTR, Betsson,  Leovegas AB, Evolution AB and Entain are all legit companies with some  exciting stories.
10. There  are hidden upsides to sportsbetting stocks. Could DKNG start to offer  stock bets and even take on HOOD? AI could reduce costs of doing  business by half. Vig isn't getting cheaper, so our EV/EBITDA ratios  decrease favorably.

The company is investing in battery recycling start-up Redwood Materials, which is run by Tesla (ticker: TSLA) co-founder J.B. Straubel. The two companies are working to create a closed-loop recycling chain for lithium ion batteries. Cars, of course, are recycled, and investors know about scrap steel prices and scrapyards. But traditional cars have been on roads for generations. EVs are relatively new, and there are only about 2 million on U.S. roadsâout of roughly 276 million vehicles. And because new EVs likely wonât be scrapped for years, battery recycling is just in its infancy.

âFord is making electric vehicles more accessible and affordable through products like the all electric F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit, and much more to come,â said Ford CEO Jim Farley in the companyâs news release. âOur partnership with Redwood Materials will be critical to our plan to build electric vehicles at scale in America, at the lowest possible cost and with a zero waste approach.â

Ford is investing $50 million in Redwood to âexpand Redwoodâs manufacturing footprint.â Ford plans to invest $30 billion between now and 2025 developing EVs and building its own battery capacity with partners. Redwood has plans to be more than a battery recycler. Eventually, it wants to be a battery materials company, potentially producing battery raw materialsâwhich are typically produced in northeast Asiaâin the U.S.

Redwood isnât publicly traded. But Li-Cycle (LICY) is a battery recycler that recently became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Li-Cycle stock jumped about 4% in premarket trading, far above the roughly 0.5% gain for both S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures.

I know itâs kind of risky investing on these but I believe itâs a high-risk high-reward thing.

Iâm not going to talk about how good or bad this is about the society or other ethical matters. This publication focuses on investments and this is definitely **THE** theme you should be looking at now that itâs still early. 

 Stock Plays

There are not many plays here yet. The most obvious one is **Facebook** stock. Zuck specifically said the vision and target of his company is the metaverse [here](https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview). Facebook also is the owner of one of the very few companies that produce VR headsets like the Oculus 2 (of which I am an owner). Once you experience life in VR itâs not difficult to see how this will develop in the future if you are not close-minded nor a tech hesitant person. Oculus has the upper hand and is further up in the race against other companies. Their device is much cheaper than competition and doesnât even need a powerful PC to run. I bet their next iteration will truly bring VR in the masses and in the office space. They did recently launch [VR for work](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/).

**Apple** is getting into the AR space mostly. They will be introducing AR glasses that would for sure be of higher quality (and price!) than their competitors. But Apple stock is already sky high in my opinion.

**Roblox** did an IPO recently. We talked about it previously [here](https://loftfinancial.com/the-kids-in-the-block-sandbox-like-roblox/) and I still think itâs a good play especially now that the stock dipped from itâs ATH significantly. One should always be wary of stocks that are not profitable after many years but they are building a kind of Metaverse on their platform and they have ***44 MILLION*** daily users for f\*\*\* sake!

**ATARI** has a revival and is slowly becoming active in HW consoles. They say they will also build Atari Hotels in Vegas and they are heavily involved in the blockc space.

Lastly, another niche small cap gamble (itâs a penny stock) is[ **ARHT media**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARHTF/) which is a company producing Holograms. This is not a metaverse theme per se but related. Recently ABBA announced they will be conducting [concerts ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2021/09/02/abba-announces-first-album-in-40-years-and-will-play-live-shows-as-holograms/)using their digital holograms instead of going up the stage themselves. Does it suck? Mmmm yes and no depends on who you ask.

Long term very few if any make a difference. 

So a few words of advice from people who's views I respect:

Noble winning economist Richard Thaler on Bloomberg was asked what investors should do when there is a market crash. 
He replied: Stop watching your channel and do something else. 

Thaler has also conducted studies that prove that the more information investors look at and the more they change their portfolio the less money they make. 

He also stated Rip Van Winkle would make the best investor (in the fairytale he woke from a coma after 20 years). 

Peter Lynch during a market crash that wiped 30% of his billion dollar fund was asked what he was doing. His reply: I was playing golf. 
His point?  During a crash the best thing to do is nothing. 

Lastly, Brian Estees,  a portfolio manager tells a story of when he was a young stock broker.  A old lady came to him who had bought $11k of Walmart stock 17 years prior. She had not checked them since. 
He cashed out over $2 miliion for her. 
He then checked how Walmart had performed over the last 17 years and discovered they had last over half their value on 5 occasions but had always recovered to make new highs.

I eventually bought 2,000 of them. I knew when buying them that I would need to pay an additional $11.50 per warrant in order to exercise them and turn each warrant into a share of common stock. The way I saw it at the time was that the company was loaning me $11.50 to buy the warrants that I would have to pay back later since the price difference between the warrants and common stock was usually (but often greater than) $11.50. This made buying warrants at the time a better deal than buying the common stock.

However, it was announced after I bought these warrants that they wouldn't be asking the warrant holders to pay an additional $11.50, they were instead doing a cashless redemption. Warrants could be exercised with each warrant now worth 0.4458 shares of common stock. Failing to exercise the warrants would basically make them worthless after a certain date. I was ready and willing to pay the additional $23,000 (2,000 x 11.50) fee to receive 2,000 common stock, but that was no longer an option.

For the 2,000 warrants that I purchased, I paid $23,478.35. This equated to a cost per warrant of $11.74. If I would have had to pay the additional $11.50 per warrant, then my total price for each of these 2,000 warrants would have been $23.24 (11.74 + 11.50). However, my cost basis is now much higher than that. I still paid $23,478.35 for the 2,000 warrants, but now I only own 891 (2,000 x 0.4458) shares of common stock. Doing the math, that means that each common stock that I received from these warrants has a cost per share of $26.35 (23,478.35 Ã· 891). If I would have bought the shares instead of the warrants, then I would have had a cost per share of around $23.24 (more or less depending on the actual common stock share price at the time I bought the warrants). This means that I cost myself an additional $3.11 (26.35 - 23.24) per share by buying the warrants instead of buying the common stock.

Hello all!

First post in this sub. Basically, Iâve been following this ticker for a bit, and some seemingly good news was dropped today (see above link). Basically, I considered it to be good news, but it didnât seem to catch on whatsoever. Looking for opinions and for someone to take a look at this ticker and help me understand if thereâs something Iâm interpreting wrong about the PR drop. 

The stock, surprisingly in my eyes, took a hit today. I canât figure out why and feel like thereâs something Iâm missing in my assessment.

A lot have been debated on this sub about the Evergrande problem. My favourite angles are those that claim the whole industry is in the same situation, those that point to rule change made by the CCP more than a year ago to improve accounting as the start of this problem or even those that discuss power struggle inside the CCP.
I feel these angles provide the opportunity for intelligent analysis. I have no clue if they will bailout debt owners or employees &amp; suppliers or retail clients. My bet is they wont do it like the US did in 2008. It will be more subtle aimed at small Chinese clients and employees and suppliers leaving most debt owners to dry.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 21, 2021**

*Sorry for the delay in posting the recap, was having technical difficulties on my end*

Stocks closed lower once again in another volatile session as market participants continue to digest the fallout from Evergrande in China and anxiously wait for commentary from the Fed regarding their monthly monetary policy meeting set to be released tomorrow, Wednesday. 

Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, the global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrandeâs lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poorâs said, it was unlikely that Evergrandeâs default would cause a credit crisis âby itselfâ but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, âBanksâ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for Chinaâs financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.â 

In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserveâs latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Wednesday. The monetary policy statement and subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will lay out what the Fed thinks of the current state of the economy and potential signal when the Fed will begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. 

Julia Coronado, President of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said âI think on balance the Fed is still marching forward. They're going to tell us that they're about to taper this year, or their plan is still to taper this year. That sets up November or maybe December as a formal announcement. So this meeting is really not about doing anything, it's just about reminding us that the economy is making progress, the recovery is under way and the Fed is beginning a very gradual process of normalizing, as they like to say, monetary policy.""

The policy decision will also come alongside an updated economic projection from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, including the first look at their expectations for 2024. Based on the central bank's latest projections from June, the FOMC's ""dot plot,"" or chart of interest rate expectations, suggested the median member expected two rate hikes by the end of 2023.

They're going up against Abbvie with a biosimilar for Humira called Yuflyma that was recently shown to be equivalent and should role out in Europe soon.  They've also got a biosimilar for Remicade called Remsima (Inflectra in the USA) that's already on the market.  

The news now is that Celltrion is partnering with 180 Life Sciences (ATNF) to supply drugs in 180's clinical trials.

&amp;#x200B;

On the face of it, this is not that interesting.  But as an long-term 180 Life Sciences ($ATNF) bull, I assure you, it's very interesting.  The founders of ATNF are the guys that originally discovered Remicade and Humira.  They're carrying all sorts of trade-secrets around in their heads that could enhance Celltrion's biosimilars program as it accelerates into manufacturing in China.  On top of that, ATNF has a very attractive patent portfolio in its own right and is in the middle of running a handful of clinical trials.  Reading between the lines, this simple supply deal starts to smell a lot more like a potential merger, especially since ATNF's latest clinical trials will be using Celltrion's drugs.

Celltrion is traded on KSE (Korean Stock Exchange) and ATNF is traded on the Nasdaq.

Tesla is the current king of the EV industry, having accounted for nearly 80% of EV sales in 2020. Between their S, 3, X, and Y models, they sold [a total of 200,561 cars in 2020](https://electrek.co/2021/02/16/tesla-owns-electric-car-market-us/) according to *Electrek.* (Note that these numbers significantly differ from the investor decks, which show a total of 499,647 cars delivered in 2020, and 386,181 through H1 2021.)

Theyâre actively gearing up for continued growth, undertaking significant capital projects in Texas (Y, CT), and Germany (Y only), continue to expand the capacity of their existing production facilities in California and China, and are developing the Semi, Roadster, and the as-yet-unnamed future product.

Beyond that, due to their acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla is also a dealer in the renewable energy business, via their rooftop solar photovoltaic products and home &amp; grid-scale battery storage products, notably also introducing their Virtual Power Plant [pilot program in California](https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-virtual-power-plant-powerwalls-help-california-grid/) this past July.

Straight from the company itself - Teslaâs mission is to accelerate the worldâs transition to sustainable energy.

**Necessary Caution**

Disclosure up front - I am currently bearish on Tesla, with a growing put position fairly far out of the money. I'm not looking to dig my heels in on this position, though. Unlike many bear theses I have seen, though, I don't see Tesla crashing to double-digits anytime soon (barring some rather specific severe catalysts), and despite alluding to a possible frenzy-fueled crash to $100, I don't think Burry does either. There are a lot of legitimate risks to Tesla's value to analyze without resorting to bankruptcy theories or accusations of fraudulent accounting, and there are many legitimate reasons to support its stratospheric valuation, as well. I happen to think the risks outweigh the justifications, but that's just me. I'll be exploring those over this series of posts.

**First things first - Bull Cases**

I won't be analyzing these in this post, but I'd like to acknowledge them. ARK Invest has some well-known theories to support their 2025 price target of $3000 - Establishment of a proprietary ride-hailing service, success of autonomous full-self driving, increased market share in both EV and insurance, and continued realizations of manufacturing efficiency as described by Wright's Law.

Possibilities ARK left out of [their Monte Carlo Model](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model):

\- Significant expansion of their grid storage, solar, and VPP businesses

\- Cybertruck captures a significant market share of electric trucks

\- Tesla Semi goes first to the market and captures majority share

\- Excess production capacity/expertise is used in a significantly profitable way (Think AWS)- Simplified government subsidies tip the auto market in favor of EVs

If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend perusing ARK's Monte Carlo model. It's an impressive piece of work, though I was dissatisfied with how every case was simply a bull case, even their ""bear case"" and ""minimum case."" Considering Tesla's mission, I also found it odd that ARK ignored Tesla's stationary battery and solar sectors entirely, but...moving on.

**Risks** **- or, the Bear Cases**

There's a lot here, so I'm only going to highlight my top favorites:

\- PR tipping point results in mass recall/sales freeze - Tesla crashes receive a disproportionately amplified level of negative attention and exaggerated coverage. Enough incidents like the one captured in Coral Gables, FL, though, (dashcam footage showed a fatal instant, explosive failure of the older battery pack upon an impact from beneath) would result in regulatory action and put a chill on the market for Tesla vehicles similar to that experienced by the Boeing 737 MAX.

\- **Black Swan** \- Unlike ARK's case of ""Tesla goes bankrupt"" my black swan case is a complete loss of confidence in the security of **all** Tesla products due to a successful cyberattack which causes real-world havoc. ([In general, the average member of the public may tend to penalize the victim of the cyberattack, not the perpetrator](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.13256.pdf).)

\- The ""Solar City"" trial ruling ends with Elon Musk repaying Tesla the full cost of Solar City's bailout. Due to the leveraged nature of Musk's Tesla holdings, this would possibly lead to a significant chain of margin calls for him if he lacked the liquidity to pay this amount. (As Elon is the holder of around 20% of Tesla's stock, this would be a minor effect on the price.)- A rise in interest rates results in significant increase in the cost of Tesla's debt service.

\- **My personal focus** \- The ""everything shortage"" results in a pileup of undeliverable, unfinished inventory and/or a significant slowdown in production, drastically reducing their asset turnover. (Of note, Model S/X production went from 16,097 in Q4 2020 to 0 in Q1 2021, though this was completely offset by an increase in Model 3/Y production)

**Valuation**

I'm not going to set a price target in this post. I'm not there yet. I'll just provide the following for now. As Tesla is behaving more as a growth company, I did an extended DuPont breakdown of their finances. Whole-year 2021 projections were created by making a simple assumption that the H1 2020 to H1 2021 change percentage would be identical for H2 2020 to H2 2021. A flat $5B was added to 2020 assets and equity.

Item (in millions)201920202021 (projected)Net Income-8627216,009EBT-6651,1549,578EBIT-691,9946,230Revenue24,57831,53658,625Total Assets34,30952,14857,148Total Equity6,61822,22527,225Tax Burden129.62%62.48%62.74%Interest Burden963.77%57.87%153.73%EBIT Margin-0.28%6.32%10.63%Asset Turnover71.64%60.47%102.59%Financial Levr.518.42%234.64%209.91%Rtn on Equity-13.-3%3.24%22.07%

As the ""best minimum"" ROE is 15%, if H2 2021 financial reports result in 2021 coming in close to my crude projection, ROE will approach 22%. Given that only two years ago ROE was negative, and was in the single digits last year, I feel that this is a sign of unsustainable growth, and the right mishap could finally force a rapid correction in the stock's price. Until then, my overall valuation is: **overvalued**.

I've now moved on and have been wondering about wild and true black swan events. So my question now is: what if a company showed up who held such advanced technology that they could considerably take over any industry within a relatively short period of time? So, what would happen to the stock market if it was ""attacked"" by essentially two forces? The first force would be a fund so technologically advanced that it could reliably predict stock prices?  The second force would be a company that could wipe out any competitor due to sheer market force and technological ""magic"". I realize that loyalty exists and that brands matter, but if a company arrived tomorrow that offers amazing internet, for $1 a month, then it would wipe out all ISPs almost overnight (just an example). I guess this is more of a scenario than a question, but I'm just curious about what people imagine time frames would be like and how it would affect society?

I've now moved on and have been wondering about wild and true black swan events.  So my question now is: what if a company arrived who held such advanced technology that they could considerably take over any industry within a relatively short period of time?  So, what would happen to the stock market if it was ""attacked"" by essentially two forces?  The first force would be a fund so technologically advanced that it could manipulate the price of stocks to extract a reliable rate of return that could also be hedged against?  The second force would be a company that could truly wipe out any competitor due to sheer market force and technological ""magic"".  I realize that loyalty exists and that brands matter, but if a company arrived tomorrow that offers amazing internet, for $1 a month, then it would wipe out all ISPs almost overnight (just an example).  I guess this is more of a scenario than a question, but I'm just curious about what people imagine time frames would be like and how it would affect society?

You all were helpful last time, and here's an early draft of how I've put together some of these ideas so far: https://www.thomasbenedict.com/post/excerpt-from-worlds-2-initial-economic-attack 

The except in the link above is from my 2nd novel in my Worlds Series.  The story is about the discovery of consciousness as a force of nature, and while I consider it science fiction or a technothriller, it's also kind of a new category that might best be called a startup/financial thriller - if people get pumped about this kind of thing??

&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Foreign investors have finally heard the alarm bells ringing around China Evergrande **(3333.HK)**, an enormous developer with a $300 billion debt pile roughly equivalent to the annual economic output of Finland. On Monday, European and U.S. benchmark stock indexes sold off on fears of financial contagion, while credit default swaps, the costs of insuring against Chinese sovereign default, surged. Itâs about time.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;An Evergrande bankruptcy and correction in the local real estate sector will be painful, and not only for commodity suppliers. If a full-bore housing crisis ensues, it could cause an unprecedented contraction in the worldâs second-largest economy, with implications for every company that invests in or exports things to China.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Short of that, the risk of financial contagion seems limited. Evergrande dollar bonds were downgraded to junk long ago; high-yield issues by Chinese developers are mostly traded by speculators. Evergrandeâs biggest lenders are domestic banks like China Minsheng Banking **(600016.SS)** and Agricultural Bank of China **(601288.SS)**, **(1288.HK)**. Much of its recent credit was raised by paying suppliers commercial paper instead of cash. During the U.S. subprime mortgage crash in 2008, the difficulty in establishing who held how much junk prompted banks to stop lending. Yet a similar liquidity crisis is next to impossible in China, where the financial system is controlled by the state.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Some foreign trading desks will take a hit. Fund manager Amundi said it still has $25 million of exposure to Evergrande. Investment bankers who sold the developerâs bonds to clients may have uncomfortable conversations with lawyers coming up. Itâs possible too that overseas institutions have been taking on default risk without knowing it, given founder Hui Ka Yan and peersâ fondness for exotic and opaque funding channels like wealth management products.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;There may be some silver linings. The historical outperformance of property compared to every other Chinese asset class has overheated demand for mortgages and shadow loans. It has warped Chinese consumption and investment, cannibalising capital from the securities markets, mutual funds and insurance. That has played poorly to the strengths of overseas wealth managers trying to lure Chinaâs retail investors.

Well that WAS my answer till I read this article about why Cheniere missed on earnings last quarter:

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/cheniere-sees-record-lng-exports-but-commodity-price-exposure-leads-to-losses/

âThe loss came as the companyâs commodity price exposure has increased under gas supply agreements (GSA) in place with Apache Corp., EOG Resources Inc. and Tourmaline Oil Corp. Cheniere inked its latest GSA with Tourmaline in July. Under the deals, Cheniere buys natural gas at prices linked to JKM, subjecting it to commodity price fluctuations that its LNG buyers typically assume under long-term offtake agreements.â


Cheniere is doing the exact opposite of what they SHOULD be doing! They are blessed to have a business in an industry that could profit from a crazy US (Henry hub) to Europe (TTF)/ Asia (JKM) arbitrage. Right now, Henry Hub is $5 and JKM/TTF are both over $25!!! 

Why in the world are they SOURCING gas and paying based on JKM prices???? Its crazy!

Â«Â Evergrande is due to pay out interest worth $83 million on a 5-year, U.S.-dollar denominated bond, with an initial issue size of around $2 billion. Another interest payment on a 7-year dollar bond is due next Wednesday, on Sept. 29.

Analysts and market watchers largely expect that Evergrande to miss the interest payment on Thursday.

If these initial defaults happen, institutional and other foreign investors will likely be more affected compared to domestic investors in China, analysts say.Â Â»",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3057491,public,self,How long will we feel the Evergrande Saga?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psgt3u/how_long_will_we_feel_the_evergrande_saga/,all_ads,6,tickerdiscussion,612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59,Company Discussion,,,,,,,,

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

U.S. stock benchmarks were on track to post their worst daily drops in more than two months, with the skid being blamed on the potential collapse of Evergrande. The Chinese property giant is threatening to default on $300 billion in debt that could ripple through global markets. However, the downturn in the highly leveraged real-estate sector, which the Financial Times notes makes up more than 28% of Chinaâs economy, isnât the only problem for markets on Monday. Here are the other reasons-

**Delta woes**

The delta variant of COVID-19 is resulting in higher case tallies in the worldâs largest economy. The U.S. is now averaging more than 2,000 deaths daily, according to a New York Times tracker, the most since March 1, and consist almost entirely of unvaccinated people. Florida, which has vaccinated 56% of its population, is averaging 353 deaths a day. Texas, where 50% of the population is inoculated, is seeing 286 deaths a day, according to the Times. Those two states account for more than 30% of all COVID-19 deaths since March 1. 

**Fed taper talk**

Markets are fixated on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committeeâs Sept. 21-22 meeting, where Fed officials face the prospect of winding down the accommodations that have propped markets up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., even as the economic rebound looks uneven. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month since last June to keep long-term interest rates low and bolster demand.  A number of Fed officials have expressed a desire to announce tapering at the September meeting and begin the initiative before year-end. Investors are anxious about the timetable for such reductions and are also looking out for any signals of an interest-rate increase in 2022.

**Debt ceiling**

On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress to raise or suspend the nationâs debt ceiling or risk âwidespread economic catastrophe.â In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, Yellen, a former Fed chair, noted that the U.S. has never defaulted, and she said it must not do so now.

**September and stock-market seasonality**

There is a growing sense that valuations are rich and the Federal Reserveâs easy-money punchbowl will be yanked away at the worst possible time. Seasonally, September has been one of the worst months for stocks, and investors think that the market might behave true to that pattern.

**A correction is due**

Strategists think that the market is due for a significant pullback as the S&amp;P 500 has recorded more than 200 sessions without having seen a drawdown of 5% or more from a recent peak, making the current stretch of levitation the longest such since around 2016, when the market went 404 sessions without falling by at least 5% peak to trough.

**Inflation lingers**

Inflation continues to dog markets. Data recently showed that the cost of living for Americans rose in August at the slowest pace in seven months and signalled the surge in inflation this year may have peaked, but Americans probably arenât going to get much relief from these elevated prices soon.

Aside from a brief oil-driven spike in 2008, consumer prices have risen this year at the fastest pace in three decades. And a new survey by the New York Federal Reserve shows consumers expect inflation to average 5.2% in the next 12 months.

**Buy the dip?**

Investors have grown accustomed to buying market downturns, referred to as buying the dip. However, Mondayâs action, and trading over the past week, suggests that investors are becoming more reluctant to purchasing beaten-down stocks with expectations that stock values will resume record run-ups after modest declines. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed below its short-term trend line for the first time since around June, which could reflect the erosion of buy-the-dip behaviours.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 20, 2021**

Stocks plunged on Monday, with the three major indexes having one of the worst-performing days all year as market participants nervously eyed potential ripple effects from the default of the second-largest Chinese real estate company and commentary from the Federal Reserveâs September Monetary Policy Meeting set to be released on Wednesday. As has been the case for months, market participants are waiting for the Fed to signal when it might begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.66%, with the index falling more than 5% from its previous record highs for the first time all year, before somewhat pushing in the last hour of the session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.93%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.78%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed the most, closing the day 2.4% lower.

Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrandeâs lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poorâs said, it was unlikely that Evergrandeâs default would cause a credit crisis âby itselfâ but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, âBanksâ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for Chinaâs financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.â 

In this way, Evergrande has been compared to Lehman Brothers, the  Since I am not a macroeconomist nor proficient in Chinese policy, I donât feel comfortable drawing conclusions on the potential global implications of the default, though personally I do not yet see how contagion would spread globally like in 2008 given Chinaâs financial sector remains comparatively insular, unlike the US. While comparisons are being drawn to Lehman Brothers, a US bank whose bankruptcy catalyzed the global 2008 recession (which largely did not affect China), I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.

1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of âsystemic importanceâ in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when itâs forced. For example, In November 2008 the government introduced a 4 trillion Yuan stimulus package (roughly $620 billion or 14 % of 2008 GDP) for 2009 and 2010. Countless other examples exist. 
2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best, unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. 
3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets arenât great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell-off.

In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserveâs latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Monday. As has been the theme for the past few months, market participants are looking for signals as to when the Fed may begin tapering the current pace of quantitative easing. As I have said before, I remain uncensored by QE tapering, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed starts discussing interest rate hikes

The fact of the matter is, while a significant number of our imports come from China, as the end consumer, this can only perhaps benefit us with material cost. If an economy reset is due for China, we will be advantaged as the outside point.

In regards to their ""stock market."" People keep saying, when we crashed in 2008, Europe's markets crashed 10 days later.

On the inverse, having been a DCA investor since before the great recession, this is all feeling...**familiar**. The chants of ""*It's priced in*"" and ""*This is the new normal*"" are getting louder without much (any) good DD to back them up.

Everyone seems to be investor since the Gamestop fiasco. And to paraphrase The Intelligent Investor's famous story of Robert Kennedy - ""I knew it was time to get out when the shoe shine boy started giving me stock tips."" Well, I've got everyone from coworkers to the deli counter guy giving me investing tips these days.

Am i going to get out of the market? Of course not! But I am starting to think 1x and 3x inverse funds to ride through the quarter.

For those of you not familiar with Opera, Opera was established in 1996 as a browser company and it is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era. It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600m. It was listed in 2018 as $OPRA on Nasdaq.

**Opera is no longer just the browser company**. In fact, its core browser business contributes about half of its revenue through search monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by their top-rated news apps on the Android and Apple App stores. **Opera has successfully taken its browser users and funneled them to other services in News and Fintech.** They call it the Browser+ strategy.

Opera has used their browser user-base to successfully launch two key businessesâ **OPay**, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Africa in which it has a 13% stake, and Nanobank, a micro-credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and America where it has 42% stake. ([OPay is now valued at $2B after a $400m funding round and could very easily reach $3-$4B valuation by next year.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-bets-fintech-startup-opay-114500537.html))

Opera has also opportunistically invested 30m for 20% stake in **StarMaker** which is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists which is growing like wild-fire in India, Indonesia, and the Middle East. **StarMaker is a key competitor for TikTok in international markets, and has taken place as the next best thing where TikTok is banned.**

**StarMaker has grown revenue from $12M in 2018, to $29M in 2019(136% YoY Growth) , to $90M(210% YoY growth) in 2020. Opera reported that Starmaker was doing close to $180M run rate in Q1 2021.**

**StarMaker is profitable with a 2020 net income of $13M (255% YoY Growth).**

**Opera Products:**

* **Opera browser** : Among the giants, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blockers and much more. Opera browser for desktop is available onÂ  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.Â 
* **Opera GX**Â : Opera GX, the gaming bowser which Opera launched for Gamers with has unique features such as CPU and RAM limiters, Discord integration, and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, it has grown to over 9 million MAUs in just over 2 years.
* **Opera News App** : Opera News is an AI based News aggregator which personalizes news based on browsing history. It is the #1 news app in all major African economiesâ Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and the US in Q4'20, it has became the #1 and #2 news app in Germany, France and the United Kingdom and is holding strong in the top 5 in the United States. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.
* **Opera Ad Network** : Instead of relying on a 3rd party, Opera launched its own advertising network, primarily to serve its own advertisement inventory. Since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. Opera's Ad Network is tracking at $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.
* **Dify** :Â Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was pilot launched in Spain in Feb'21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.
* **Opera Gaming** : Early 2021,Â Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 9M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 9M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plan to launch a steam-like service called **GameBox** to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.

**Business Model**

* **Search revenue** : Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.Â  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.
* **Advertising revenue** :Â  Opera makes advertising revenue in two ways:  

   * Revenue shares from bookmarked links, speed dials and other various forms of affiliate advertising on its browser.Â Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base
   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY) Other revenue - This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff

**Financials**

* Opera Search and Advertising revenue has increased at 15% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2'18 to $51M in Q1'21. This revenues comes at 94% gross margin and has operating margin in excess of 30%. Opera has been investing for growth so its operating margins have been fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.Â 
* Opera has forecasted FY'21 revenue of $245M , 45% growth over FY'20. It has forecasted FY'21 income of $30M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY'21.
* With Covid recovery, momentum in advertising due to &gt;10% browser growth in EU, and continual growth of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.Â 
* Opera takes a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from their Fintech (Dify) and Gaming (YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY'21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 40% YoY for several years and reach $450M-$500M revenue in FY'23 at 30%+ operating margins.Â 

**Opera's Minority Stake**

* **Opay** \-Â Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019,Â Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay was in talks to raise $400M at over $1.5B valuation last month. Opera also monetized 29% of its 13.1% stake for $50M and has left around 10% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.
* **Starmaker** \-Â The StarMaker app, which has over 100 million installed users, is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is the top 5 grossing music app in the play store in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.Â  When Opera invested $30M for a 19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.Â  Since then it has been growing like wild-fireâ a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 yearsâÂ  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% with $180M Q1'21 run rate with sequential acceleration of 38% from $130M Q4'20 run rate.
* **Nanobank** \- Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the under-banked population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users on its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card initiatives. Nanobank was growing revenue at CAGR of 295% pre-Covidâ scaling from $22M Q1'19 revenue at 24% operating margin to $92M Q4'19 revenue at 41% operating margin. It has not yet completely recovered from Covid in India and had $50M Q1'21 revenue at 11% operating margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre-Covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ margin in Q4'21.

**OPRA SUM-OF-PART VALUATION**

* Opera is growing 50% YoY to $245M revenue(conservative forecast) at 30% margins in FY'21 with revenue growth continuing at similar rates of \~40-50% in FY'22 due to the ramp up of their Dify fintech initiative in Europe. Applying 6x P/S to FY21 revenue, Opera Core is worth $1.47B.
* StarMaker is growing at 160% YoY to projected $226M revenue in 2021. Applying 8x P/S multiple to FY21 revenue, Opera's 19.35% stake is worth $350M.
* OPay was in talk to raise $400M at over $1.5B, this funding round was successful and OPay is now valued at $2B. Subsequently, Opera monetized 29% of its stake for $50M reducing its stake to \~10%. This 10% stake is now worth $200M.
* Nanobank has a 2020 revenue of $217M at 18% Margin. 2021 revenues are projected to be $250M at 23% margin with growth accelerating in FY 22 to $550M and pre-Covid margins of 30% . Applying 6x P/S multiple to FY'21 revenue, Opera's stake is worth $630M.
* Opera has cash equivalent of $135M and has recently monetized 29% of its OPay stake for $50M.

***Adding all, Opera's Sum of Part valuation is $2.8Bâ $25 per ADSâ a 150%+ increase over its current price of $8.78.***

Analysts at BCA Research wrote in their Strategy Report for clients on Sept. 20: âWhile the U.S. is not immune to disruptions in the rest of the world, it is a comparatively closed economy that is generally less susceptible to external troubles and has minimal financial links with the Middle Kingdom.â

But the early action on Monday showed that day-to-day events, even on the other side of the world, can unnerve investors, with energy, commodity and industrial stocks hit especially hard.

The BCA analysts went on to say that a review of filings for the largest U.S. banks showed that âonly Citigroup, which operates a meaningful commercial banking franchise in Hong Kong, has direct cross-border exposures that amount to as much as 1% of assets.â Shares of Citigroup Inc. C were down 3.2% in the first few minutes of trading on Monday.

Markets were closed in mainland China for a holiday, but the Hang Seng [**HSI,** **-3.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/HSI?countryCode=HK&amp;mod=MW_story_quote) dropped over 3%.

The 8.25% Evergrande bond that has interest payments due this week was trading at around 29 cents to the dollar on Monday, according to Reuters. That is as Wall Street investors are poised to pick up where they left off last week â on a weaker footing.  

âThe dip is due to a variety of causes, including fading earnings estimates, uncertainty related to shifting monetary policy, and instability in the worldâs second-largest economy as a result of escalating crackdowns,â said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.

Markets will be closely watching for any talk of tapering at the Fedâs two-day policy meeting that begins Sept. 21. The central bankâs ultra-easy policy stance, put in place more than a year ago to help the economy cope with the pandemic, looks untenable to some given spikes in inflation.

The economy has been giving off mixed signals, though, amid rising cases of coronavirus due to the delta variant. Fridayâs losses for Wall Street came as a reading on consumer sentiment held close to a roughly 10-year low.

Analysts also were discussing the inability, so far, of Congress to increase the debt ceiling.

I hope you had a nice weekend, and let's get back at it today. Lots of stocks gapping down this morning, things could get interesting. Make sure to stay disciplined, I'll be cautious today.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* AVIR
* BRKS
* UVXY

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA
* BABA
* NIO
* BA
* UAL
* AMD
* PUK
* CLF
* AMC

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning after some choppiness in last week's sessions. The Fed is set to hold its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and we could be getting an indicator as to when the Fed will taper its asset purchase program. US Treasury Secretary called for Congress to raise the US debt ceiling, and that failing to do so would generate ""widespread economic catastrophe"". There are also concerns that Chinese Evergrande Group, a Chinese real estate juggernaut, could collapse because of major debt. Shares were down more than 10% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Adding to the fear is the broader crackdown on real estate by the Chinese government; this situation is worth monitoring, as it could have effects on the overall market. Worth watching UVXY if we continue to see fear in the market.Â 

SPY is currently trading a bit under 434, and if we see more weakness we could test the SMA(100) as support at \~432. We'll see what things look like closer to open, but regardless, we should see some volatility today. DIA is trading just under 339, after breaking down below the SMA(100) in last week's trading. We could see a retrace to the \~332 level by the SMA(200) if we continue to see weakness. Potential support levels at 337 and 335, so we could see a bounce. QQQÂ is trading a bit under 367 and is currently gapping down below the SMA(50). 370 will now be a key resistance point, and we could be in for a bigger correction if we can't get back above that 370 level today. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning, while crude oil is pulling back. Crude oil is currently hovering right around $70 per barrel, we'll see if that holds up. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 42,800 and things are looking bearish at the moment. Unless we see a strong bounce off support at these levels, we could see more selling off in the near future. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are down in premarket trading, as a result. Airlines and cruise stocks are down this morning. It will be worth watching to see if we bounce off support levels sometime this morning, or continue to see weakness. Meme stocks are showing weakness at the moment, but worth keeping on the radar.Â 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

It affected a lot of industries, and especially a great number of economic activities, which includes mining.

But for Chile, which is the top copper-producing nation, it seemed like the countryâs mining industry is not deterred at all. Copper production by mining companies in the country make up 28 percent of global output. The mineral accounts for 10-15 percent of the South American country's GDP, with much of it exported to China, the world's biggest consumer.

Even though the copper production is expected to go down from 5.7 million tonnes to 5.4 million tonnes this year, the mining sector is still pushing through the crisis with minimal issues. Despite the health panic, mining is not affected much and companies are still continuously producing and going on with their activities.

In fact, it is not the pandemic, but labor tensions are actually the main factors why there was almost a problem with the copper supply coming from the country. Codelco had to face and end a strike with their plant workers, while BHP Group accepted had a new wage proposal for their union members. Right now Codelco and BHP managed to ease the labor tensions so there is no risks or issues when it comes to the copper supply. 

Junior companies are also showing promise with their mines located in the mineral-rich country and is also contributing to the production of the mineral in the nation. Marimaca Copper Corp. for example, released the results of their reverse circulation (âRCâ) drilling completed at the Mercedes Target, which has intersected significant oxide copper mineralization from surface. 

Three Valley Copper, which has mines in Chile, just announced their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. Despite these being smaller players in the mining scene in the country, both are to show great potential and are still relevant contributors in copper production once they start producing.

With the recent gain of copper as Shanghai stocks fell 10.7% and the eased tension between workers and mining companies, I believe that copper prices will definitely rally and get affected by all these circumstances. Concerns about the supply faded, global stimulus measures are keeping the demand for it stronger, and with the coronavirus restriction slowly getting lifted up, I think we can all expect more production from the top copper-producing country in the world.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3054947,public,self,Copper prices will be affected as coronavirus restrictions fade and the mining situation improve,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prtr9g/copper_prices_will_be_affected_as_coronavirus/,all_ads,6,discussion,8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b,Industry Discussion,,,,,,,,

Gas prices for October are going through the roof!

KUB (CAD) / TPNEF (USD) looks even better with Ukraine Gas prices rising to 18,000 MCM (valuta is UAH). 18,000 MCM in September (Cubic Meters, Before VAT/Taxes) according to the table on the website and last quarter was an average of $6.50 MCF (Cubic Feet, After VAT/Taxes) in the MD&amp;A Q2. This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.

In Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).

I look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.

Please type in Google 'ueex ukraine gas prices' as I think I can't put the link here.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, they just had an update to sell their 35% interest in KUBGAS (East Ukraine). So they will be focused on clean books, RK field with electricity they want to expand, gas assets in the West, while having de-risked from the East of Ukraine.

So this should be strong earnings in Q3 and then clean books when this sales deal closes, de-risking from Eastern Ukraine. Trading below Cash and Equity (not taking into account the RK field in the books) after this deal. I believe the cash will mostly be used to further develop the RK field.

I have a good amount in USD at TransferWise now, that Iâm not using and Iâm no fan of trusting a fintech bank with my money.

Thanks to /r/personalfinance, Iâve been investing in Vanguard World, Vanguard S&amp;P 500 for around 7 years now, mostly via my Dutch and UK broker, where I used to live. Iâve recently relocated to Southeast Asia, but banks and brokers arenât very reputable here.

Iâd like to ideally use another investment broker in another country, e.g. USA, Switzerland, Singapore, a reliable EU company, etc. that allows me to invest in dollars, mostly in ETFâs. 

-	Trading212 allowed me to open a â¬-account only.
-	SaxoBank allowed me to open a $-account and an â¬-account.

The problems are:
1)	Trading 212 doesnât have any ETFâs. They are cheap in apparently, but they seem best for buying individual stocks in euros. Almost all their popular stocks are in USD, so Iâd have to convert my USD to send to a EUR-account and Trading 212 would convert the EUR in USD to buy the stocks.
2)	SaxoBank doesnât sell USD NYSE ETFâs, so I have to buy EUR ECITS ETFâs on the European stock exchanges anyway.

Iâm considering buying BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway) in $US at SaxoBank to learn about buying individual stocks and avoiding the problem of not being able to buy $US ETFâs, but the inactivity fee of $150 every 6 months could be problematic.

Iâm risk-averse in terms of doing business with a small unreliable upcoming fintech business and too much exposure to a single government. I lost my UK bank account, because of Brexit and Iâm still trying to get the money back. 

Iâm fine with losing some money or paying a little extra, for good customer service. Spending 0,5% in yearly costs over the ETF including service charge is no big deal, if it allows me to concentrate on my life and career while making some passive income.

KUB (CAD) / TPNEF (USD) looks even better with Ukraine Gas prices rising to 18,000 MCM (valuta is UAH). 18,000 MCM in September (Cubic Meters, Before VAT/Taxes) according to the table on the website and last quarter was an average of $6.50 MCF (Cubic Feet, After VAT/Taxes) in the MD&amp;A Q2. This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.

In Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).

I look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.

Due to the nature of their business, it makes sense them blowing up could really domino, but..

Evergrande is just a real estate developer. Investors will get screwed, sure, but how can this really cause financial dominos like in 2008? The bears seem really excited about this and keep posting articles and charts about how BLK and other US and international firms are the biggest bagolders. But when I look further into this I see that these firms are hardly exposed. It's pennies in their portfolios and probably less than they'd lose on a bad 1 minute candle in the equity markets.

They quote the $300b worth of bonds that will be worthless, but that's not that much to the global economy, realistically. More wealth is destroyed on a bad day for $AAPL. Additionally these were junk bonds for a long time. Were not talking triple a mortgage bonds that were ""too big to fail"" and unsinkable like the titanic.

This all also assumes that the chinese government will sit on their hands and watch a crisis unfold, when that seems super unlikely. Say what you will about the CCP, but they're not gonna let all their stellar economic growth crumble when they have:
1. More power and political will than the US did to tackle such a crisis
2. The ability to plan their economy to recover from any domino effects unlike more ""free market"" economies 
3. Knowledge of previous global housing crashes/financial crises to draw from

Maybe I'm an idiot but I just don't see how anybody should think this will cause a serious bear market in the US or elsewhere.

They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing. Right now, the Chinese government is doing what they can to control the situation (allowing them to default on loans, setting a price floor on property).

Given this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  


(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  


(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  


(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.

* Inflation (*core PCE*) has consistently been below 2.0% for over a decade.
* Now, customers are experiencing large price increases to many goods &amp; services due to supply chain disruptions &amp; labor shortages.
* Some parts of inflations may be transitory while other parts may be permanent. It will be important to the Federal Reserve to get it right because:
   * if inflation is transitory even though core PCE is above 2.0%: Fiscal policy should be accommodative (*no rate hikes*) and the business cycle should continue so supply can catch up with demand
   * if inflation is persistent + core PCE is above 2.0%:  Probably a good idea for fiscal policy to take some rate hikes to tame inflation

* **What's going on:** It's at 69.2 and well above 50 since the pandemic started so it's been difficult for suppliers to meet customer demands due to ongoing hiring challenges, extended lead times for for raw materials at lower tiers &amp; higher prices, and inconsistent transportation availability

yet, if it goes from $0.0001 to $0.0002 thats a 100% change, or a 100Bps change. i am not seeing how thats a 1 basis point change.

2. my second question is just on the definition of PIP. it states it generally uses 4 decimal points because thats usually the defined rate for USA forex. but on some like the USA/YEN, it goes to 2 decimal points. does that mean in this case, 1 PIP change is only up to 0.01?

I'm not exactly sure how to approach an incoming market crash.

Let's say the market crashes 20%...

The best course of action would be to sell at the peak, prior to the crash. Very few people would achieve this, because no body can predict with perfect timing when this would happen. Most people would be reactive, and they would sell AFTER the market starts tanking. A few lucky ones, or extremely smart ones, would sell at the peak.

Personally, I would most likely just hold and ride it out. Is this the right thing to do?

I do feel confident my stocks will fair well in the future, hence, i would feel mostly ok riding out a crash, and just holding, rather than panic selling like most would.

If i were to hold though, and ride it out, i would want to average down to get a cheaper price as the market crashes, so that when the markets do go back up, it would take me less time to start earning a profit again. Is this the right strategy?

As far as having money to invest in an upcoming crash, should i start selling some stocks now in preperation for a market crash that will undoubtably happen, but may be months, or even years away, potentially having money sitting on the sideline earning me nothing. This is the bit i find the most difficult to decide on. I do have money in a savings account, but it can't be used for investments. I do have some stocks that are currently giving really good returns, so i could shave a bit of those to free up capital. It woud reduce my investment though, and if the market were to continue going up for another few months, or even years, i would be getting less returns.

How are you guys going to handle a market crash, both before, and during the crash? Are you leaving some money on the sidelines in preperation for a crash? Are you planning on selling some stocks to gain capital to put towards a crash? Or do you have another strategy?

This post I believe is becoming more and more important as we are making record highs on the indexes almost daily. Whether we agree or not that the market is over valued, we can all see the record highs. I am reading many posts all over Reddit about an impeding crash/correction.

A correction is where the index falls 10% from the highs. A recession is 30% off the highs. A crash is 50% off the highs. To be honest, it is not likely that any index will see a crash. Even with COVID-19 we were at a recessionâ¦.but hey if you are a bear, and see gloom that is up to you.

The point of this post is, since the start of time, there have been many corrections, some recessions but the market has always come back. In years past this come back would take 3-5 years to set new all time highs. This market is unlike anything ever seen, with free trading, all this information, and the allure of quick money. I say that because this extreme makes it very likely if we do have a correction or crash that within a year your ticker may come back and make a record highâ¦ so what do you do? That is the question.

Example: If you have a $100 stock right now, you are 100% positive it will fall to $75 within a year, just do not know when and for how longâ¦. You do know exactly 1 year from today it will be $125â¦.

1.Do you sell right now and buy back later, not sure when, how long but you sell now at 100?

2.Do you keep your position and buy another position as it starts to dip and wait for a comeback?

3.Do you just keep trading it on the way down and on the way up as well?

4.Do nothing but drive yourself crazy as it drops and say to yourself damn, damn I am in the red and cry until the day you are up again?

Just curious, please share ideas and thoughts. Because in the market history, provided that you have chosen a good ticker, this has happened time and time again and people kick themselves in hindsight for missing outâ¦ so what will you do?

We see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. 

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus one of the many small cap companies looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars or semiconductors, the hype has already consumed supply stocks such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/h5kxnlz/) describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It'll double or triple in a couple years.

&gt;I'm an engineer focused on raw materials, so I'm a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.

Other tickers mentioned in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp6gfl/lesserknown_stocks_that_supply_popular_industries/) for this topic include:

**$ILMN:** Provides tools for genomics work. Seems to have a high P/E and is a bit of a popular genomic play, though.

**$LEA and $ADNT:** Auto parts suppliers. Pretty cyclical industry and unstable charts, however.

**URI**: United Rentals, construction equipment rentals. Might benefit from infrastructure spending. Not exactly what we think of as supply but I'll leave it here.

**$SWKS:** Semiconductor supply picks are popular but this one was mentioned the most as people believe it to be undervalued.

**$MTRN:** Metals company involved in parts for ""EV, space, and renewables.""

**CDW:** Provider of IT programs for business, government, and education. Again, not exactly supply but it was mentioned and piqued my interest.

Coinbase was one of the most highly anticipated IPOâs on the NASDAQ in 2021. The company has over $180billion of assets on the platform and over 68 million users worldwide.

**About**

Coinbase is one of the go-to platforms for people wanting to invest in crypto the easy way. Coinbase was one of the first platforms to make cryptocurrencies easy for people to buy and sell.

The previous method prior to Coinbase involved terminal commands and remembering lengthy codes. A slide from one of the companies pitch decks illustrates this perfectly.

**Coinbase Stock Price**

Coinbase is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol COIN (COIN:NASDAQ) and currently trades on a market capitalisation of US$51.26 billion with a stock price of $243.

**Coinbase IPO Price**

* **What was the Coinbase IPO Price?** Coinbase completed its direct listing on the NASDAQ with a reference price of $250 when it IPOâd back in April 2021.
* **What date did coinbase IPO?** Coinbase IPOâd on April 14 opening at $381 before briefly topping $400.Â 

**Coinbase Latest Financial Report**

The group in the quarter generated over $2.0 billion in net revenue, including $1.9 billion in transaction revenue and over $100million in subscription and services-based revenue. Net income for the quarter was $1.6 billion and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion.

&gt;**As volatility and crypto asset prices are highly correlated with trading**  
**revenue, the crypto market environment heavily influenced our Q2 financial results.**  
*Coinbase Q2 FY21 Report*

The above quote from the group seems to indicate that a period of volatility also means that trading volumes will be higher, it is assumed that the group means both highs and lows in the underlying cryptoâs encourage users to trade more often.

In the groups, 2Q21 report to the market Coinbase points out that As of March 31, 2021, Assets on Platform totalled $223 billion, representing 11.3% of the total market capitalization of crypto assets.

As the industry develops over time, we expect this to increase as Institutional companies will start committing more of their funds into crypto. We are only really at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to institutional participation in crypto. Â 

**Coinbase Income Statement 2Q21**

Coinbase has increased its key metrics from revenue, gross profit and net income across the board since releasing its first set of quarterly results in June 2020.

The AGR on Coinbase Income is over 4000% since their first set of quarterlies, whilst we canât see this continuing we see no reason why income cannot grow at large double-digit multiples until at least 2023.

**Is Coinbase Reliant on Bitcoin?**

In group financial reports the dependence on trading volume in relation to Bitcoin has decreased over time with trading volume in other crypto-assets now higher than Bitcoin. Interestingly Ethereum Trading volumes as of 2Q21 have now also outstripped BTC, this is potentially due to the higher volatility of the crypto.

**Coinbase Fundamentals**

* **PE ratio (TTM):** 17.91
* **Price to Book (PB):** 13.80
* **Price to Sales:** 10.4x
* **PEG Ratio:** 0.99x
* **EPS (TTM):** 13.58

The company has a PE ratio of 17.91x and a price to sales ratio of 10.4x. The PE ratio of 17.91 sits below the average NASDAQ PE Ratio which is currently around 28x, the group P/S ratio, however, sits above the NASDAQ Average of \~5x

**Peer Comparison**

Square and PayPal currently trade on P/E ratioâs of 249x and 67x respectively. COIN stock for comparison is trading on a P/E of 17.91x. Coinbase Stock is also trading at a similar P/S ratio, however, generating significantly more EPS than SQ or PYPL.

**Coinbase Stock Competitors**

Coinbase has a number of competitors internationally:

* Coinbase
* Binance
* Robinhood
* Blockchain
* Bitrex
* Bitfinex

Coinbase has no publicly listed competitors in which to compare their valuations other than Robinhood (however these companies are also generating revenues in significantly different ways).

Interestingly enough, although Binance is not a publically listed company we can obtain data through the companies âburningâ of their BNB token.

Outlined in the original Binance Coin whitepaper, the company pledged to burn BNB tokens equal to 20% of its quarterly profits. With BNB tokens valued at $390 million burned this quarter, Binance should have made close to $2 billion in profit since April.

We see an advantage in COIN Stock being the only publicly listed company on the list with a focus directly on crypto. Our reasoning for this is around institutional and high net wealth individuals and the perception of trust in the company.

We see as more and more institutions look to invest in the crypto-economy they will seek stability and trust in whom they are conducting business with, as COIN Stock is publicly listed we believe this creates a higher perception of trust.

**Should I Buy Coin Stock â Key Business Risks**

1. Coinbase may not be able to trade every asset on our centralized exchange for regulatory reasons
2. Erosion of the companies transaction revenue due to increased competition
3. Declining interest in crypto-economy, however the reverse is also COIN Stocks key upsides.
4. Hacking of the system

**Key Upside Opportunities**

* Increased growth of the crypto-economy as a whole (think of Google in the 2000âs, as the internet grew, so did google)
* Subscription based revenues to continue growing at large rates
* Release of NFT platform on Coinbase (Potentially buying OpenSea)
* International Expansion into Japan and Germany (Flagged in Q2FY21)
* Increased traction of Coinbase USDC (StableCoin)

**Ownership Structure**

Coinbase stock is owned predominantly by the General public at 40.9% with individual insiders and institutions taking up the next largest slices of the structure at 23.6% and 22.5% respectively.

CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is the largest individual holder in COIN stock with 17.12% of the float. Co-Founder Fredrick Ehrsam also continues to hold large portions of Stock. Other notable holders include **ARK Invest** and the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.

**Summary**

The only real negative we hear around the investment community is the risk of new participants into the space, however, we believe Coinbase is potentially 5-years ahead of any competition based on the below:

1. Coinbase Cloud, allowing devs and users to intergrate and develop platform ontop of COINâs ecosystem and hooking directly into the platforms APIâs
2. The trust of Institutions in Coinbase, as more and more institutions seek exposure to crypto assets, they will typically rely on the most trusted solution.
3. As the only publicaly listed crypto company of this nature we believe institutions will be attracted to the perceived âsecurityâ of COIN Stock over other competitors

Coinbase Stock has continued to generate significant growth in revenues and earnings over the past 8 quarters, with a significant turning point in the last year. We believe Coinbase Stock will continue to surprise the upside and see the potential for significant growth from institutional demand in the crypto-economy in the near term.

COIN Stock has spent over 7 years developing systems and overcoming challenges that the company now plans to commercialize through the use of the Coinbase Cloud Platform. We see this move as the Amazon of the crypto world and will provide the tools required for other companies to build products on top of.

For Roth, one-third to QQQJ, one-third to IWN, and the last third for more speculative thematic type ETFs.

2- What if I sell my new shares before the end of the year? If I made some profit, would I pay less taxes due to my first purchase having a higher cost basis?

3- Does the number of stock matter? For example, lets say I bought only 1 share, after selling my 200 shares? Do I still owe tax due to wash sale?

-Larger share of extremely high margin Refreshed Model S vs prior quarters this year

This should be a great exercise for the community so that we can all help eachother get insight into why you would hope for a dip on a certain stockâ¦.. At what price, and what you are looking for.

We need to try and be realistic because some readers may also look at this idea, do DD and may thank you later. By saying you hope AMZN dips to 1,500, or MRNA to 200, GOOG to 1,000. I am not sure if you are helping anyone, because I believe most would jump in too!

Now if these are indeed a ticker you await a dip, maybe you can set a realistic price and just an idea of where it may go. It is a simple exercise, would be better of course if you actually did own it before, really would buy it back and maybe where you may see it months from now.

I have about 1,200 tickers on 29 watch lists, so I have many to choose from. Some have never heard of this ticker and so it may help many just to get an idea.

ZIM, I have been a trader of this since it IPOâd. The company is a cargo shipper that has absolutely beat the last 3 earnings reports badly! They reported earnings over 7 dollars recently with a 2 dollar special dividend. The stock has run to an all time high near $60â¦..

I hope this dips back to 45, it was there a few weeks agoâ¦ and in a year if they keep executing this can be 75-90. They make cash and can pay dividends. Yes, rates are high now, yes ports are backed up, but they will still beat top and bottom line.

I started using [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com), which is an outstanding platform that also puts out some great videos every week (the best being The Final Bar with David Keller). One thing I've enjoyed is being able to set alerts for the stock I both own and follow. Here are some of the alerts I've been using in case this is helpful to anyone. These are easy to implement using the Stockcharts alert/scan engine.

First, Stochastics hitting 80% after being above, or 20% after being below, tells me when a stock or ETF is ""letting off the gas"" and will stop going up, or has started ""hitting the gas"" and might start to up. This is usually the first heads up that I should pay attention to something as I hate kicking myself later for not catching when things start a move.

MACD crossovers for all the stocks I follow is also helpful. Basically I get one email alert per day and can mark which are start to dip, or rise. 

Obviously, moving average crossovers are good to get notifications for. 

Having alerts that tell me when a stock's SCTR rating (a comparison of how that stock is doing to all other stocks) 25, 50 or 75 in a bullish manner (hitting from below) or bearish (hitting from above, due to the stock falling) helps me from missing stuff returning to an uptrend after taking a break.

I'm also testing a trend-following system by Authur Hill that uses Stochastics on a 125 day period, as a final system to tell me when I should or should not be in stocks. Any stock that hits 40 is a ""sell"" and 60 is a ""buy,"" which I just use as another piece of information so I don't miss stuff. 

This system isn't perfect since I get a ton of alerts right when the market opens (which is 10:30 pm for me as I'm in Japan), but it's a nice way to get an impression of what's moving and why.

*****
&gt; The Federal Reserveâs much-anticipated meeting next week may not be quite as exciting for markets as some investors had been expecting in the usual choppy month of September.
*****
&gt; The meeting is the highlight of the coming week, traditionally a negative time for stocks. Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, with the exception of the small-cap Russell 2000, which ended the week up 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials begin meeting Tuesday, and end their two-day session with an announcement Wednesday afternoon. That will be followed by a press briefing with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; The economic calendar is light, and there is mostly housing data. Starts and permits data are slated for Tuesday, existing home sales numbers are set for Wednesday, with new home sales figures coming out Friday. A handful of companies are reporting earnings, including Costco Wholesale, FedEx and Nike.
*****
&gt; The Fedâs meeting may not be as eventful as investors once expected. The central bankâs move away from its bond-buying program has been expected by some strategists to cause turbulence for stocks. But the Fed is likely to only discuss tapering at the upcoming meeting and, at most, signal it could slow the bond purchases later in the year.
*****
&gt; âTheyâve been very clear in my view on the guidance on tapering. I think they get an âA plusâ on communicating their intentions around the balance sheet,â Bank of America head of U.S. economics Michelle Meyer said. âThey said they want to take baby steps and they have.â She expects an announcement in November and the actual cut in bond purchases to start before year-end.
*****
&gt; The unwinding of the $120 billion a month bond buying program is important since it would be the first major move away from the extraordinary policies the Fed used to fight the pandemic. It also takes the Fed a step closer to interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; # Debt ceiling risk
&gt; âEverybodyâs been calling for a correction, and itâs always hard to see what the catalyst could be. The catalysts for a correction right now are as clear as theyâve been all year long,â Morgan Stanley Investment Management head of global macro strategy Jim Caron said.
*****
&gt; For now, Caron sees the Fedâs communications in the week ahead as less of a risk for markets than other simmering issues, like the debt ceiling, the potential for more taxes and uncertainty surrounding the White Houseâs infrastructure bill.
*****
&gt; Congress has until sometime in October to extend the debt ceiling before the government runs out of funds and defaults. Political rhetoric around raising the debt limit, which would allow Treasury to issue more debt, has been building. The White House warned Friday the economy could enter a recession if Congress fails to act.
*****
&gt; âI think the Fed wants to stay out of the fight at this point. Thereâs just too much ambiguity,â Caron said. âTheyâre not going to announce tapering. Their statement is going to be carefully worded. The bar is really high for them to say anything hawkish right now. Between now and the next meeting, we should have a pretty good idea about the debt ceiling and where the infrastructure stands.â
*****
&gt; # What the Fed could do
The odds for a September tapering announcement from the Fed fell sharply after Augustâs softer than expected employment report showed just 235,000 jobs were created, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; Economists now mostly expect a November announcement, but the September meeting could be important for what else the Fed says.
*****
&gt; The quarterly forecasts of Fed officials are released along with the 2 p.m. statement Wednesday. They include new economic projections and an updated interest rate forecast.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/vV59aJ6.png
*****
&gt; âI donât think they want to say anything thatâs slightly hawkish, but the dot plot could come out that way,â Caron said. The so-called dot plot is the Fedâs interest rate forecast, which is the anonymous interest rate targets of Fed officials presented in a chart format.
*****
&gt; Some Fed watchers expect the central bank to move its interest rate forecast forward slightly. In June, the dot plot showed two rate hikes for 2023 and none for 2022.
*****
&gt; âThey are two Fed officials from having a half a hike and they are three Fed officials from getting a full hike penciled inâ for 2022, Bank of Americaâs Meyer said. âI think the dots will show the first hike is in 2023, but it is possible that shifts. ... I think if it shifts, the problem the Fed will have is to communicate the difference.â
*****
&gt; Meyer said Powell has emphasized the asset purchase programâs unwinding is not linked to the Fedâs move to raise interest rates from the current near-zero level. If the interest rate forecast moves forward, it could suggest to the market that the Fed will wind down its bond program and immediately move on to a rate hike. The bond program is slowly expected to be unwound over the course of six months or more.

&gt; The major indexes ended the past week with slight losses. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.6% for the week, closing Fridayâs session at 4,432.99. The Dow lost 0.1% for the week. The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 0.5% for the week to 15,043.97. The 10-year Treasury yield was higher on the week, at 1.37%.

&gt; September as a whole has been weak for the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 down just under 2%.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan technical strategists, however, do not see the big downdraft expected by some analysts.
*****
&gt; They note the S&amp;P 500 has held above 4,420 to 4,435 trend support levels and another key level of 4,367.
*****
&gt; âAs a base-case view, we believe the index holds that support and rallies in the fourth quarter. Even if the market breaks support and sees a near-term increase in realized volatility, we continue to think the 4238-4257 summer-time breakout area will put a floor under the index,â the strategists wrote.

&gt; # Earnings
Investors continue to watch for earnings warnings ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, which starts in mid-October. The concern is that supply chain risks will continue to crimp revenues and could hurt margins.
*****
&gt; There are a few companies reporting in the week ahead, and they should comment on supply chains and rising costs. FedEx reports Tuesday; General Mills releases earnings Wednesday, and both Nike and Costco report Thursday.
*****
&gt; Nike is being watched closely since it is expected that supply chain issues will hurt its profits and it could continue to have issues getting products to sell.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 down 25 of 31 during week after September quarterly options expiration, average loss 0.94%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September quarterly options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 31 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the above sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA â1.03%, S&amp;P 500 â0.94%, NASDAQ â0.88% and a sizable â1.50% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

&gt; # Mid-Pack Performance for Post-Election Year Octobers

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term âOctoberphobiaâ has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and donât get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; Post-election year Octoberâs are neither great nor bad since 1953, ranking mid-pack across DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 with gains averaging from 0.9% (DJIA &amp; Russell 1000) to 1.4% (NASDAQ). DJIA has the best historical odds for gains having advanced in 12 of the last 17 post-election year Octobers. Despite the best average gain, NASDAQ actually has the worst record, declining in 6 of the last 12 post-election year Octobers. A 12.8% gain in 2001 boosts its average. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

&gt; # Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover

&gt; Happy Jewish New Year 5782! May it be a sweet year for you all! As we informed you early this month the market tends to exhibit weakness during the Jewish High Holy days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. Perhaps it is the marketâs annual repentance for its own sins that drives the market lower over the years during the ten days of repentance or the days of awe as they are often referred. This trade ends tomorrow on Yom Kippur, September 16, but as of todayâs close DJIA is down about 0.8% from the close on Rosh Hashanah.

&gt; We attribute this perennial pullback to the fact that market liquidity drops as many market participants step away from the market and likely square positions ahead of these ten days. These days of awe also land during the seasonally weak end of Q3/beginning of Q4 period as fund managers restructure portfolios and prepare for the October 31 mutual fund deadline. This has made September the worst month of the year and contributed to the phenomenon of Octoberphobia.

&gt; But there is a flipside to this trade. Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover. This has an even greater accuracy ratio than Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur up 72% of the time with average gains of 7%. And as I am sure our followers will realize this trade get a big boost from seasonal market strength during Q4 and Q1 and of course the Best Six Months of the Year November-April.

&gt; # Insurance Suddenly a Concern For Small Businesses

&gt; In addition to the various indices regarding small business conditions, the NFIB also surveys firms on what they see as their most pressing issue. In August, by far the most common issue among respondents was labor-related. A record 28% reported quality of labor as the biggest issue; up 2 percentage points versus July. Another 8% reported cost of labor as their biggest issue which was slightly lower than July. On a combined basis, the 36% reporting either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issue was the joint highest reading on record; tying August and November 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Labor.png))**

&gt; Especially over the past several election cycles, the results of the NFIB survey have tended to be impacted by politics. For example, over the past few presidencies, when a Republican is in office there has been a lower percentage of respondents reporting either taxes or government red tap as their biggest issue and vice versa when a Democrat is in office. That combined reading has now completely reversed the uptick following the election of President Biden as labor concerns have increasingly come into focus.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091421-NFIB-MIP-Gv.png))**

&gt; While government-related problems are still the second biggest concern(s) on a combined basis, there have been some other notable moves this month. The percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue rose back up to the pandemic high of 13% this month. The Great Recession was the only other period that has seen as elevated a share of respondents seeing price increases as their biggest issue. Additionally, that excludes those reporting cost of labor as an issue.

&gt; As for what the rise in Inflation as a problem may have borrowed from, one of the most notable has been competition from big business. The reading has seen a gradual decline since the end of 2019, and now at only 5%, it is tied with several months between September 2009 and September 2013 for the lowest reading on record.

&gt; # Why Evergrande Isnât The Next Lehman

&gt; Chinese property developer Evergrandeâs liquidity crisis has sparked fear and massive selling in Chinese property stocks over the past several weeks. The big question is could this be the first domino to fall, sparking a systemic risk scenario, similar to when Lehman Brothers went under 13 years ago this week? The good news is we donât think so, but weâll get to that later.

&gt; With more than $300 billion in liabilities and only $15 billion in cash on hand, Evergrande is currently the worldâs most indebted real estate developer. Worries are mounting that starting next week it wonât be able to pay $84 billion of interest due (according to Bloomberg), along with potentially missing a principal payment on at least one of its loans.

&gt; With Evergrandeâs share price down more than 80% this year, investors are clearly voting with their pocketbooks, while the chart below shows the pressure its dollar bonds have been under as well, at deeply distressed levels to the tune of 28 cents on the dollar recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.17.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Multiple downgrades have happened the past two weeks, and some rating agencies are noting that an outright default is probable. Should this happen, what could the fallout be? With 1,300 real estate projects in 280 cities in China, could Chinaâs communist government intervene to avoid a messy default? So far that answer has been a resounding no, with the company instead looking to banks and other creditors to help the impact of a default.

&gt; The bad news keeps coming, as yesterday, Evergrande suspended trading of itâs onshore corporate bonds, after yet another downgrade, taking it one step closer to restructuring or default. So is Evergrande Chinaâs version of Lehman Brothers? Here are three reasons we donât think so.

&gt; * First, the dollar bonds will likely get restructured, but most of the debt is in global mutual funds, ETFs, and some Chinese companies and not banks or other important financial institutions. Remember, Lehman Brothers was held on nearly all other financial institutionâs books, so not nearly as many institutions will be impacted by this versus Lehman.
&gt; * Secondly, we think the odds do favor the Chinese communist government will get involved should there be a default. They are holding out as of now, but the fallout could be too great for them to avoid intervening.
&gt; * Finally, Evergrande has tangible assets that can be sold off to settle financial obligations. Their assets arenât great and creditors know that the company is in financial trouble , so the value of its assets arenât likely worth as much as they think but it will still help settle some debts. Remember, Lehman didnât have hard assets it could sell off whereas Evergrande does.

&gt; âAlthough the impact from Evergrandeâs liquidity crisis is enormous, the good news is the fallout hasnât started to spillover to other markets,â explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âShort-term funding markets are acting just fine in China thus far; remember, it was the money markets in the U.S. that first started to show cracks in the system in early 2008, well before the wheels fell off.â

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Chinaâs money markets arenât showing any signs of systemic risk. These tend to be the canary in the coal mine, and the fallout appears to be fairly contained as of now.

&gt; LPL Research downgraded our view on emerging markets to negative from neutral last month, due to concerns over Chinaâs regulatory crackdowns and heightened political risk. Now with Evergrandeâs liquidity crisis in the mix, we continue to recommend an underweight to emerging markets in portfolios.

&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that could clearly change on a dime. Although the Chinese communist government has avoided helping Evergrande so far, we think the odds do favor some type of eventual bailout to limit the ripple effect from a potential default. We will continue to watch the action in the short-term lending markets for clues if this is spiraling into something larger.

&gt; # Retail Sales Surprise To The Upside

&gt; U.S. consumers shocked economists in August with their willingness to spend in the face of recent jitters over the economic outlook.

&gt; This morning, the U.S. Census Bureau released August retail sales data showing overall retail sales grew 0.7% month-over-month vs. a consensus forecast for a 0.7% drop, while retail sales ex autos and gas rose 2% month-over-month vs. a consensus forecast for no change. Auto sales remained under pressure because of supply chain bottlenecks and higher prices, accounting for the large gulf in the numbers. The big beats come on the heels of disappointing July data, which received additional negative revisions, taking a small bit of the shine off Augustâs numbers.

&gt; Nonetheless, the spending resilience shown in this report is receiving an overwhelmingly early positive response, as economic releases in recent weeks have generally been surprising to the downside. COVID-19âs resurgence in recent months is surely to blame for a significant portion of the lowered expectations, but consumers have also been forced to contend with rising prices, severe weather events, lukewarm payroll gains, and cuts to enhanced unemployment benefits.

&gt; âThere have been several reasons to question the consumer outlook recently,â explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âAnd yet, the old mantra ânever bet against the U.S. consumerâ continues to ring true. This has been a volatile series of late, but we look for the consumer to continue powering this economy well into the future.â

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, retail sales ticked significantly higher in August following a difficult July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.16.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The familiar theme of goods over services consumption seen during prior virus flare-ups is evident in this report, as well as a back-to-school boost. General merchandise stores (3.5%) and nonstore (online) retailers (5.3%) showed large monthly boosts, reversing a disappointing July. In addition, furniture and home furnishing stores rose nicely (3.7%). Meanwhile, food services and drinking places (0.0%), an in-person segment most impacted by virus caution, held steady against forecasts for a decline, while volatile electronics and appliance stores (-3.1%) showed weakness.

&gt; We continue to believe that successfully tackling Delta could set up a fourth quarter growth rebound despite many strategists increasingly turning sour on the second half of the year. Cases from this latest COVID-19 wave are starting to decline, and plentiful job openings and impressive wage gains data should prevent a major income shortfall resulting from the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits. Consumers also still have elevated excess savings relative to historyâin the neighborhood of $2 trillion. We continue to look for a resilient consumer, as well as for services spending to play catch-up vs. goods spending in coming months.

&gt; # Inflation Shows Signs Of Moderating

&gt; After a crazy summer of nosebleed inflation readings, we may finally be starting to see signs of transitory inflation.

&gt; The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data this morning, which came in softer than expected. Headline CPI climbed 0.3% month-over-month vs. estimates of 0.4%, while core CPI jumped only 0.1% month-over-month vs. estimates of 0.3%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were larger, but we find more usefulness in the monthly numbers until we get past the weak comparisons versus a year ago.

&gt; To be sure, a resurgent Delta variant played a part in dampening overall inflation, and future reports will help clarify the magnitude of its effectâbut, expectations were already lowered to account for this dynamic and the data still missed.

&gt; One major takeaway from the report is that the composition of the decline suggests that the long-awaited abatement in price spikes in supply-constrained segments of the economy could be upon us. These relatively smaller parts of the overall CPI basket were driving an outsized portion of the gains this summer. Used cars and trucks (-1.5%), airfare (-9.1%), and lodging away from home (-3.3%) all declined significantly month-over-month.

&gt; ââTransitoryâ has certainly been lasting longer than we originally thought it would,â said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âBut the CPI components that displayed summer volatility resulting from supply chain bottlenecks are beginning to resolve themselves as expected.â

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, used car and truck prices have experienced a drop-off after the summer surge, which saw them become the posterchild for bottleneck-driven inflation from semiconductor shortages.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/blog-chart-9.14.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we have highlighted in previous inflation blogs, we make special note of the trend in rents since they are viewed as âstickierâ parts of the inflation outlook and count for more than 40% of the overall calculation. Moreover, the Delta variant likely has less of a direct effect on rents compared to some of the other components mentioned earlier. As such, ownersâ equivalent rent of primary residences rose 0.25% month-over-month, down slightly compared to the prior two months, a modest pace that is unlikely to spook even the most hawkish inflation watchers.

&gt; Gauging the Federal Reserveâs reaction function to inflation and jobs data is fast becoming the marketâs primary focus. Following Augustâs weak payroll report, market participants have mostly pushed back their expected timelines for tapering asset purchases so long as inflation does not spiral out of control in the meantime. Judging by the early market reaction, todayâs softer inflation numbers are confirming that narrative.

Understanding the new policy.

In line with the new FINRA rules, our new policy allows for only one flag removal within the life of an account.

What if your account is flagged?

If your account is flagged for pattern day trading, you'll have to maintain a minimum equity balance of $25,000 at the start of each trading day to continue day trading.

I'm still learning, and i'd love for you guys to help with that learning progress.

I sold some shares earlier today since several companies within my stocks portfolio were giving some good returns after investing in them for a year, so i wanted to sell the profit and keep the initial investment so i could see some realized gains, and have capital available for future share purchases.

I use Yahoo Finance as my portfolio tracker, which works exceptionally well. In Yahoo Finance i put in the amount of shares i sold, and for the price it sold at, and i noticed that it decreased my average share purchase price significantly. In Yahoo it is labeled as 'Average Cost Basis'.

I sold shares in 5 stocks, and in all 5 it had this dramatic positive effect of decreasing the Average Cost Basis. I don't possess enough knowledge to know why it decreased my average share price after selling off some shares for a profit, so i'm hoping someone here will be able to ELI5 so i can understand the reasons behind this.

The other thing i noticed, was that in my Yahoo Finance portfolio tracker, once i had sold all those shares, my overall return went up by several percentage points. Surely, if i'm up say 25% total, and then i sell some of those shares, i would still be up 25% total. The only thing that has changed is the fact that i have cashed out a few shares.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 17, 2021**

Stocks declined today, reversing from yesterdayâs gain given today was a quadruple witching event and market participants continue to digest a slew of new economic data and the potential implications for monetary policy. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.97% down, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.19% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.53% down. As of todayâs close, September is headed for its first negative month all year.

Today was the quarterly quadruple witching, an event wherein individual stock options and futures, and index options and futures, all expire the same day. Typically, this event has elevated volume and volatility on the day and days leading up to it. Definitely one of the reasons for todayâs decline. 

With the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. 

A few days ago, Chinaâs retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.

All the recent data will factor into the Federal Reserveâs latest assessment of the economy, which is set to be released next week via the meeting minutes. Market participants are anxiously waiting to see if the incoming meeting minutes have a signal regarding the timing to announce plans to begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. 

Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said âI think itâs really a tug of war at the moment that is underway, which is to say, thereâs still good news on the economy. In fact, in the last two days, we've gotten some good regional Fed survey reports and today's retail sales number. But at the same time, it's in the context of this overall deceleration of growth we've seen so far in the third quarter \[and\] worries about the Delta variant.â

**Highlights**

* According to the University of Michiganâs closely watched consumer sentiment survey, sentiment improved only slightly in September after reaching its lowest level since 2011 in August. The headline index in the institution's Surveys of Consumers ticked up to 71.0 in the preliminary reading, compared to the 70.3 posted in August. Consensus economists were looking for the index to improve to 72.0 in September.
* Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc will give a one-time bonus of $1,250 to its full-time pharmacists and a $1,000 payment to part-time pharmacists, the drugstore chain said on Friday, as major retailers try to retain people amid intense labor shortages. This is a similar effort other retailers have employed.
* Irish regulators raised privacy concerns regarding Facebookâs (FB) new smart glasses. The concern comes that people have a difficult timing  telling whether the glasses are filming or not
* Tencent (TCEHY) opens WeChat, the super app with more than $1 billion users, to allows rivals to display their links. This comes after Chinese regulators banned the practice of Chinese tech companies banning links to rivals within their platforms

Its when a new month opens at last months close price and closes under Last months close and current months open price

ELI5: January - Closes at $10, February - Opens at $10, Closes at $5

This is essentially a running trend right now since the beginning of the S&amp;P500.
We are looking to close a bear month as far as what TA shows for the current price action of the month of September.

Keep in mind that we still have two more weeks of movement so this can change.

But whatever price is on September 30th if it is lower than $451 we are closing a bear month.

BUT if we close UNDER August's Open price of $440 then we are in HUGE Bearish territory.

Currently no positions to hedge until confirmation. My current Target price would be $387 if we do close a bear month for September, i expect this to hit within 120 days after September closes.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3049657,public,self,Prepare for the Pain,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pq6oq7/prepare_for_the_pain/,all_ads,6,advice,823be0a6-65e6-11e5-9784-125ee764bc01,Advice,,,,,,,,

Today, I noticed that NTDOY was nearing its 52-week low ($56.72, currently at $60), and I decided it may be a good time to buy some shares, as I'm generally bullish on Nintendo. I try to aim for companies that dominate a sub-sector of their related market, and Nintendo appears to have very much done that with the handheld gaming market. 


However, upon checking their ticker this morning, I noticed a strange pattern over the past 10 days (10 min candles), shown at the bottom of [this pic](https://imgur.com/a/HchhQHn). (This pic isn't going to be too friendly to those of you on mobile, so I apologize.) 

***
Firstly, the ADX seems to be making wild swings every day, with OTO Buying dominating one day, and the OTO Selling dominating the next day (shown at the bottom.) This seems to have no effect on the price however, which seems to tank OTO everyday, after opening |1-2|% away from prior close. This pattern starts around 9/1-9/3.

***
Secondly, the price has regular major disparities between Close and Open, without any significant extended hours trading. I've seen major hops like this happening on meme stocks, but that's usually when paired with a lot more extended hours trading.

***
Lastly, there appears to be some major institutional sell-off on 9/9 and 9/15. When I check the institutional holding via Fidelity, I see -0.1%. How is this possible? Would short positions result in ""negative holdings""? Why are institutions so bearish on Nintendo? I mean, their stock has had its hard times in the past, but - IMO - they've demonstrated how their ""missteps"" can lead to great things (without the Wii and Wii U, there wouldn't be a Switch.)

The pause in stock futures also came a day after data showing stronger-than-expected retail sales, but a jump in weekly jobless claims, all ahead of next weekâs two-day Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting.A busy week of data included softer-than-expected consumer prices on Tuesday, which left both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 lower, as investors fretted that underlying price pressures may not ease up. And while While Street firms have expressed nervousness as stocks grind higher, Ozkardeskaya said a correction is being prevented by âthe fear of missing out a further rally in equities, the so-called FOMO, and the fact that there is no alternative, the so-called TINA.â

While the U.S. 10-year yield is now above 1.30%, an advance to 2% that many forecast earlier this year has yet to happen, the analyst said, adding that âthe high inflationary pressures leave investors with no place to go but the equities. Therefore, the U.S. indices will continue claiming new highs in the coming sessions.â

With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* ZI
* IVZ
* LCID
* ABCL

Gapping DOWN:

* LOGI
* NTES
* PTGX
* OPAD

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower this morning after we have seen some indecision in the last few days of trading. We have seen some choppiness this week, and today should be no different. We saw pretty good numbers for August retail sales, but I'm still worried about the negative catalysts that could potentially influence the market, particularly a slowdown in growth. The Fed has said they will likely taper their asset purchase program before the end of the year. Powell has said this will not immediately raise interest rates, but I think we could see a reaction from the overall market.Â 

SPY is currently trading right a bit over 445, and has recovered off the premarket lows which tested the 444.50 support level. If we break down back below that level, we could see more red today. If we can hold up and see a bounce, I'll be watching price action around the 446 resistance level. DIA is trading a bit over 347. With support at 346 and resistance up near 350, I'll be watching to see if we can break out of that range either today or next week. As of now, I'd expect it to test support. QQQÂ is trading just under 378. If it sees weakness, it could retest the \~375 support. If it sees some strength, I'll be watching for movement back up to 380 resistance. Gold and silver are up this morning, while crude oil is pulling back a bit after the recent strength. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 47,500, and I'll be watching price action closely today. I'll be watching for a break out of the 46,700-48,500 range, and will be watching cr\*\*to stocks closely when B\*\*coin is close to those levels. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Airlines are looking bearish in the near-term, unless they can break out of the current downtrend on the daily charts. Meme stocks are worth keeping an eye on to end the week. I'll be watching to see if GME can hold up over the 200 level.Â

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

First of all, please don't comment ""don't buy china stocks"" and stuff like that. Obviously, the risk in buying HK stocks looks of being way higher than the risk of buying SP500. If you don't want to think about a particular Hong Kong stock, please stop reading this.

Health care/pharma stocks in Hong Kong have been beaten up in the past months, the cause is regulatory fears. I have decided to try to do: ""buy the fear, sell the greed"". There are many pharma/healthcare companies in China, even Legend Holdings (that is controlled by Chinese Science Academy) has invested in Byer Dental, and through its subsidiary Legend Star into Zonsen Peplib Biotech, Rghenta Therapeutics, etc., some details: [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/legendstar/recent\_investments](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/legendstar/recent_investments)

So while I understand that CCP wants to make healthcare more accessible and less expensive to people (doesn't the US want it as well?), I don't think they will kill the industry and its stocks.

So I was looking into buying opportunities. By looking into Hong Kong Pharma stocks, I have stumbled on China Shineway ([http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/quote/quick-quote.aspx?symbol=02877](http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/quote/quick-quote.aspx?symbol=02877) ) and these are the reasons I have bought it:

\- the company has no debt

\- the current price of a stock is 7.75HKD, while the company had 6.0HKD in cash according to the last financial report: [http://api.aconnect.com.hk/Attachment/68080](http://api.aconnect.com.hk/Attachment/68080) . As the ex-dividend date passed, the company should have at least 71% of its market cap in cash. Unbelievable.

\- in that financial report, the company had a very good first half of 2021.

\- over the past 5 years, the company has increased cash values per year and is profitable, even with the current price it trades approximately at its book value, while at this time PE TTM is 13.047.

\- the company raised its dividend and made a statement that it plans of increasing the dividends in the future, and the current yield TTM is 9.4%.

Sounds too good to be true. I have checked a dividend history: [http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/analysis/dividend.aspx?symbol=02877](http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/analysis/dividend.aspx?symbol=02877) and the company has 16 years of dividend history. It's a small cap, so it's risky, but it doesn't look like a fraud.

By looking into its products, it is mostly in traditional Chinese medicine products, which is a fairly big segment in China. I'm located in Europe, and in my country, when people are sick, they tend to buy some traditional medicines (along with medicines) by knowing that it won't hurt them. My assumption is that Chinese people have similar buying habits when they are sick. The company has OK website for Chinese standards. I don't know much about medicine, but for me, it's the same boat if I look into this or Caterpillar or a Goldwind, a wind turbine manufacturer - I don't know much about their products, their competitors, or the company outlook.

Shineway Pharma has very strong insider ownership, 72.6% out of which one person holds 72.39%. It looks to me he is holding the company strong financially through the years and decided to start unloading the accumulated cash pile (through dividend increase). No registered insider buying on selling in the past 1 year in HKEX.

So I took this as a value pick. Assuming the company continues to unload the cash through the dividend (and lowers its book value) the market cap would go down and its PE value would increase (assuming the company performs the same Y2Y) until equilibrium is found.

Have I overlooked something? Did I do a fundamental analysis very well?

(BTW, in January I have picked China Medical System [http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/quote/quick-quote.aspx?symbol=00867](http://www.aastocks.com/en/stocks/quote/quick-quote.aspx?symbol=00867) on 8.9HKD, the current last price is 14.98HKD, unfortunately, I haven't sold this on 20HKD+ on the nice gain, still that gain is currently more than Microsoft, ...

I work in the field of alternative data (indirect metrics of companies' performance that quantitative hedge funds use to increase their alpha). Since the beginning of this year, I've been trying to make this data more public and accessible for analysis by retail traders (to let you, fella traders, be guided not by intuition and your third eye, but by real precise data). Earlier Iâve already analyzed some of the companies by a singly selected metric -[ trafficâs growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mceny3/ive_analyzed_the_websites_of_the_top_3000_public/),[ number of employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md7y4m/ive_been_analyzing_the_data_on_employee_growth/),[ hiring dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mfwjwe/ive_analyzed_job_openings_for_the_top_3k_public/).

Just recently I decided to aggregate the available data and display the top companies that grow most dynamically by all monitored parameters.

The following metrics have been taken into consideration:

* Website - unique visitors per month
* Social networks - viral posts and followers growth
* Hiring activities - number of employees on Linkedin, open job positions over 3 months
* Social buzz around the company (ticker mentions on reddit/twitter)

I took the history for the last 3 months for all the metrics. The interval for most metrics is once a day. My analysis involved 3.2K of US public companies. **Thus, hereâre the results:**

**- $**[SPCE](https://contora.ai/ticker/spce#alexa_website_traffic) (VIRGIN GALACTIC HOLDINGS) **-** Virgin Galactic is an American spaceflight company

**- $**[ICLR](https://contora.ai/ticker/iclr#linkedin_employees) (ICON PLC) - developer of drugs to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries

**- $**[TYL](https://contora.ai/ticker/tyl#job_openings) (TYLER TECHNOLOGIES INC.) - provider of software to the United States public sector

**-** **$**[PLTR](https://contora.ai/ticker/pltr#reddit) (PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES) - big data analytics company

**- $**[FAT](https://contora.ai/ticker/fat#linkedin_employees) (FAT BRANDS INC.) - fast casual restaurant chain.

**- $**[XPEV](https://contora.ai/ticker/xpev#facebook) (XPENG INC.) - Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer

The list seems to be controversial, but it gives a lot to think about.

If you want to see some other metric that I'll use for the analysis - do let me know, I will gladly research this subject. I'd love to hear any feedback here in PM or in the comments.

Here are the details:

Capital: $17,100.

Put Contracts Sold: 19 contracts, Expiry: 9/17, $9 Strike, Total Premium Received: $760

Since peaking at $12 in June itâs crashed back down to levels not seen since peak Covid hysteria. 60%+ drop weâre talking. At this pace youâd think theyâd be going bankrupt before the end of year (hint: theyâre not). So if youâre down for bargain shopping 60% off isnât a bad place to start. 

Upside Risks...
Considering the heaping pile of dog shit share price this is currently trading at, it wonât take much at all to change trajectory and bounce 25%+ quickly - itâs already done so a number of times.  But Iâm not just talking about short term takeoffs, Iâm. talking about the mid-term 3-5X events we all salivate for. 

So here are 10x upside risks that could instantly change the game for Casper:

1. BUYOUT/TAKEOVER - 
This is fairly straightforward. Once itâs announced youâre too late. But this company is pulling in $600M annually. And have a solid brand with $700M+ already spent in advertising. Theyâre the OG mattress in a box. Theyâve raised $340M in capital...before the IPO. Nearly (should have) sold to Target for $900M.  And theyâre GROWING. Sure, theyâre not yet profitable. But theyâre sure as hell worth more than $200M!?  And Iâd say theyâre in a better position today than they were at their IPO value of $476M. So you have got to think competition must be kicking the tires while sheâs down so bad. She was trading at $12 barely 3 months back! If a larger comp scoops them up for $300M they get an established brand with 600M sales and growth opportunity...instantly changing the top line. 

2. ANALYST UPGRADES -
Not rocket science, upgrades = market cap. But the point here is the LOWEST PT is $5.50 - 10% higher than today! The average is $8.55!!  WTF I donât even want to do that math. So yeah, when youâre tits deep in shit...things can only get better. An upgrade could be enough of a catalyst to shoot higher. 

3. IMPROVING SUPPLY CHAIN -
One of the biggest issues right now is supply constraints. Demand is there - theyâre selling $3K mattresses like never before. But supply constraints have throttled their ability to meet demands. Supply chain improvement = more sales. More suppliers = redundancy = $$. Simple. 

4. LOWER RAW MATERIAL COST - 
In case youâve had your head in your ass lately the prices of raw materials in this case foam making chemicals like urethane have exploded (they call it âinflationâ) . This ate into the bottom line in Q2 and will continue to Q4 likely. If costs come down faster than expected, CSPR hits profitability earlier than expected and here comes price/sales of 1.0+ and we can all party with the real WSB soon enough ($25 to make that happen)

5. SUCCESSFUL COST REDUCTION AKA RESTRUCTURING - 
They have already announced cost cutting measures to bring Casper Labs to NYC. Theyâre working more remotely and have streamlined staff (bye). This just increases pace to profitability and see #4 - P/S 1.0+ - and I can move out of the basement finally..maybe

6. ADDITIONAL FINANCING / SEC OFFERING -
Preferably financing here, but again simple: additional $30-60M in financing deal shuts down any CH.11 talk for at least 18 months. Plenty of time for Pfizer 2.0 to work itâs magic and lube up the supply chains on the way to profitability. Maybe I could get a van....

7. MANAGEMENT CHANGE -
Shouldnât be surprising, it did just happen, albeit in a minor way. But a CEO change could be the thing that lights the fuse on this ship. Philip has done great, but if thereâs a seasoned veteran in the background to take the reins then hello 200MA. 

8. NEW PARTNERSHIPS!! -
Bed Bath Beyond. Sleep Country Canada. Can anyone say Mattress Warehouse?? Partnerships are what is going to keep Casper around and relevant.

9. LOCKDOWN 2.0 -
Casperâs DTC game is lighting it up. God forbid Delta or Mu or Gamma end up closing down retail, but if they do I know where Iâm buying my next mattress.  This could turn out to be a good thing for Casper like 2020 was...Margins are great online. 

10. THE SHORT SQUEEZE -
Canât ignore the impact of the short squeeze. No itâs not going to $300 a la $GME, short of Steve Jobs himself taking the helm, but thereâs more than enough SI - 4+ days worth - to make a big impact in the event #1-9 materialize. More important, itâs so oversold right now that once momentum indicators turn positive, and theyâre trending in that direction, every algo and desk jockey out there is going to pump this like my wifeâs BFâs enhancement device...not that the needs it. 6-12+ glorious months of gains to be had. With a little luck and good execution it could easily hit true unicorn status $1B market cap and PK can finally ride off into his new venture. 

For comparison, this is exactly what Casper is trading at vs. its peers....oh what a sweet discount.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. 

With the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. 

A few days ago, Chinaâs retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.

In a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. 

**Highlights**

* A host of news coming out of Facebook (FB) after journalists reviewed internal documents from the company. Not going to get into it here, but I recommend you check out was is going on surrounding Facebook.

For members, 20% CBD oil in 30ml bottles will be 20% cheaper and 20% stronger than the cheapest CBD on the market, the company said.

Under the new pricing scheme, a 30ml 20% CBD product will also offer members 50% more CBD or 50% less cost than the average prices of 20% CBD found on a recent review of well-known brands in the market, Sativa added, with other products in the newly launched range also offering significant discounts on competitors' prices.

With its Goodbody brand guaranteeing the best quality and price on the market, Goodbody will guarantee a customerâs money back if a CBD oil of the same quality and strength as Goodbody CBD is found for a cheaper price.

Executive chairman Geremy Thomas said: âCBD is a great product but is too expensive for consumers. Today Goodbody branded products will be offered to members at major discounts to competitor offerings.

âFollowing falling prices of raw materials in the CBD market and improved efficiencies, we are delighted that due to our ability to manage and test the whole process we are able to lead the way in offering consumers the best quality at the best price, and, as a trusted brand we are prepared to put a guarantee behind that.â

Announcing a new corporate strategy in the summer, Sativa said it planned to build a membership modelÂ for more predictable revenues as well as securing sales through well-known online platforms, extending its product range, secure distribution agreements throughout Europe and carry out M&amp;A to increase its product range and revenue.

**Company Overview**

**Website**: https://www.selectquote.com/

**Market cap at publishing**: $2.3B

**Price at publishing**: $13.80

**Price Target**: $20.96 (52% upside)

**CEO**: Tim Danker

**Headquarters**: Overland Park, KS

**Founded**: 1985

**Employees**: 3,300

**Company Overview**

SelectQuote, Inc. operates a technology-enabled, direct-to-consumer distribution platform that sells a range of insurance policies to consumers from various insurance carriers in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Senior; Life; and Auto &amp; Home. It distributes senior health policies, such as medicare advantage, medicare supplement, medicare part D, and other ancillary senior health insurance-related policies, including prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing plans; term life policies; and non-commercial auto and home property, and casualty policies. The company was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas.

The first thing I like about SelectQuote is they have a simple and easy-to-understand business, they are insurance brokers. They are not an insurer and therefore are protected from any risks associated with underwriting. SelectQuote just sells insurance on behalf of insurers primarily via their website and collects commissions. Commissions are earned once the plan is activated and again for subsequent renewals, they also receive performance bonuses from many of their insurance partners when hitting certain quotas. Currently their lifetime value of commissions or âLTVâ which represents commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of an approved policy for their two biggest segments, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement stands at $1,260 and $1,269 respectively. SelectQuote estimates that their market share is less than 2.5% in each of the three segments they operate, allowing for plenty of room to grow.Â Â Â Â 

**Financials**

SelectQuoteâs income statement for the year ended June 30, 2021 looks like this:

 https://imgur.com/uXGvNHY 

Between 2018 and 2021 CAGR for revenue is an impressive 59% with a 76% increase in revenue over 2020. EBITDA and net income are also up over 40%, all very positive signs of a growing company.Â 

Here is a breakdown of where that $938M in revenue came from in 2021:

 https://imgur.com/iZh5w4i 

$729M or 77% came from their senior segment which is basically medicare insurance plans. The fact that they are focusing so much on Medicare is significant because that is where most of the future growth will come from as weâll see in the sections to come.

Some YoY comparisons I like to make:

 https://imgur.com/sEdCCfH 

The 80% decrease in FCF is primarily due to the adjustment of $333M in commissions receivable to the net income when calculating operating cash flow but this should positively affect their future FCF as those pending commissions are converted to cash.

**Insider Buying**

This is actually how SelectQuote first hit my radar, I saw large amounts of insider purchases and I decided to dig a little deeper into the company.

 https://imgur.com/Ap2cRUu 

As you can see, there have been 13 flat-out purchases by the CEO, CFO, COO, and directors in prices ranging from $8.75 all the way up to $13.28 on September 13th, 2021 in addition to eight option exercises. The total value of all purchases comes out to more than $8M. The most notable purchases are the Senior President dropping $2M, the CEO dropping $1M, and the COO dropping $2M, all in Aug 21âwhen the price was near $9. As an investor, you obviously love to see this. No one knows the company better than these guys and they seem to know that the stock has plenty of upside if they are willing to splashdown that much of their own cash.Â Â 

**Analyst Consensus**

Donât just take it from me, here are the views of âprofessionalâ analysts. There are 7 analysts covering SelectQuote who have an average PT of $17.93, with a low of $13 and a high of $25. The targets are very much in line with my own PT of $20.96.Â

### Outlook

**Growth Potential**

So what does the future hold for SelectQuote? Growth, and lots of it. Growth will come in the way of a larger TAM and a more aggressive push to activate more policies. There are several ways for seniors to sign up for Medicare. The first is to sign up for the âtraditionalâ government-issued insurance and the other is to sign up for a private market solution, which is basically Medicare offered through an insurance company, this is called Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is SelectQuoteâs biggest segment and accounted for 77% of their revenues in 2021. Why is it so important for SelectQuote to focus on Medicare Advantage? Well, the market is growing quickly and so will their share of it. The market is growing thanks to favorable demographic trends that will see more baby boomers reaching 65 years of age. In 2020, the percentage of the population reaching 65 was 15.6%, thatâs up from 12.9% in 2010. On average, 10,000 baby boomers are expected to turn 65 every day, or nearly 4 million per year for the next 10 years. Not only will there be more people eligible for Medicare but our grandmas and grandpas are now internet-savvy technophiles. Internet usage among older generations has increased from 40% in 2019 to 75% in 2021,Â  meaning more online shopping that includes everything from diapers to insurance.Â 

There were roughly 60M Medicare policies in 2019, 27M were through Medicare Advantage, representing 38% of the market. Of the 27M Medicare Advantage plans, SelectQuote only accounts for .55M or 2%. According to analysts, the Medicare Advantage market alone is expected to swell to 37M by 2025. If they can reach just 4% of the market by that point, theyâll have roughly 1.5M policies which, if they can maintain their LVT of $1,260/policy will total \~1.9B in Medicare Advantage revenue alone. I believe they can do even better than 4% because of their improving online targeting and aggressive hiring of agents. As of June 30, 2021, SelectQuote employed a total of 1,356 core agents and hired an additional 3,000 flex employees during the Annual Enrollment Period which is a long way of saying busy season in the insurance industry. In comparison to 2020 when they had 1,000 core agents and 1,400 flex agents, an increase of 36% and 114% respectively. They are also ramping up their marketing by spending $385M in 2021 vs $185M in 2020, a 108% increase.

**Acquisitions**

In April 21â SelectQuote launched an online platform called Population Health which is designed to âprovide awareness and education for seniors to ensure the full utilization of their health benefitsâ. The website is designed to ultimately make contact with MA patients and understand their needs to get them the best care for them. In doing so, they are able to connect these patients with one of their primary care providers (generating commissions) or provide a service of their own. In order to facilitate the growth of Population Health, SelectQuote created SelectQuote Ventures Inc âSVIâ to identify potential partnerships and potential acquisitions. So far they have acquired InsideResponse, an online marketing consulting firm for $65M, Lead Distribution Company, which does what its name suggests for $33.5M, and Express Med Pharmaceuticals or SelectRx for $24M.Â 

https://imgur.com/ULNVlKV 

 SelectRx is an interesting pharmaceutical distributor which handles everything there is to handle regarding medications. After gathering information through a consultation, they automatically refill and package medications in easy-to-read and understand packaging and mail it out to their subscribers. SelectRx should provide a healthy ROI, especially when used in conjunction with Population Health. SelectRx is expected to generate $120M in revenue in FY2023 with EBITDA around $20M, not bad for a $24M investment. Both platforms are already performing well as the data below shows. 

 https://imgur.com/Qs9pQXL  

**Conclusion**

Today I told the story of a company with a simple and solid business that is at the pinnacle of expertise due to its long exposure to the insurance brokerage business. Although they have been around for a while, they are just starting to hit their stride with the large influx of cash from their IPO ($350M) when they were priced at $20/share. A company that is operating in a market that is undoubtedly growing along with an aging population and who is aggressively seeking to increase their share of said market. They are off to a great start by growing their senior revenue by 101% between 2020 and 2021. They are not just resting on their laurels and focusing on senior revenue but creating a new platform (Population Health) and making acquisitions like SelectRx to expand their offerings.

Probably the most telling point I touched on in this article is the insider buying. SelectQuoteâs management at all levels is so convinced of the future of their company that they are willing to splash down large bundles of their own cash all the way up to $13.34/share and Iâm not sure they are done yet, I would look for more insider buying in the months to come. If they are so assured of the companyâs future why the hell wouldnât I be?Â Â 

**Valuation**

I use a simplified discounted cash flow analysis based on Aswath Damodaranâs teachings at NYU which uses assumptions about future cash flows that are discounted to todayâs dollars in order to reach a present valuation. I used the companyâs own financial forecasts to guide me up to the year 2022. The discount rate of 6.67% is based on their WACC which was calculated using the assumptions seen below in the âWACCâ section. I used 1.2% as the terminal growth rate for the purpose of being conservative. The current value per share I get is $20.96 representing an upside of 53%.

 https://imgur.com/uCPMzl1  

**Price Target**

I have a price target of **$20.96** for SelectQuote.

**TL;DR:** Grandparents are getting older and know how to use computer, will use computer to buy Medicare through SelectQuote, stock price go up.Â Â

I have not initiated a position in any companies mentioned in this article, however,

The world produces about 40 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year (thatâs 1 billion tonnes). In order to reach the global warming goal of 1.5Â°C proposed by the Paris Climate Agreement, the world needs to be essentially carbon net zero or negative by 2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says a 20 Gigatonne/year reduction in CO2 emissions will need to come from switching to electric cars and transitioning energy sources from fossil fuel, coal, and natural gas to solar, nuclear, geothermal wind, or hydroelectric. As for the other half, there are a lot of things where we just donât have a green alternative for: airplanes, industrial furnaces, freight trains, tanker ships, etc. To deal with this other 20 Gigatonnes of CO2, the world is going to have to adopt carbon capture technology on a huge scale. The IPCC says that carbon removal technology will have to be on the order of 100-1000 Gigatonnes of CO2 per year over the 21st century. Itâs clear there is currently a huge opportunity for carbon capture companies.

So much so that some oil and gas companies are turning their attention to it. Occidental Petroleumâs CEO has said that they are becoming a âcarbon management companyâ. Big names like Microsoft have committed to going carbon neutral by 2030. Only one way to do that. Hereâs another quote:
âAccording to most climate models, decisive carbon removal together with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed to limit global warming to below 2Â°C from pre-industrial levels. To reach that target, it is forecast that the carbon removal industry will grow to the size of todayâs oil &amp; gas industry by 2050.â (Source) [https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sonar/sonar2020/sonar2020-carbon-removal-insurance.html]

I should mention here that there are 2 types of carbon capture, one where they strip a concentrated source of CO2 like the off-gasses from combustion. The other is called Direct Air Capture where they strip regular atmospheric air of CO2. Both have a big role to play.

You might be thinking, canât we just plant more trees? Reforestation will help but it will take 3x the area of the USA to remove 10 Gigatonnes/year of CO2. There just isnât enough land for that.
Carbon Capture can do what trees can do in far less space. It is going to be a huge industry and has to be a huge industry in the fight against climate change.

Many governments are introducing carbon taxes. Canada already has one and plans on ramping it up to $170 CAD/tonne by 2030.

**Stocks**
This is such a new industry that there aren't many public companies. Here are a couple:

CNSX: DELT is a Canadian company that strips CO2 from concentrated sources like flue gasses. I like them because the Canadian carbon tax will help them a ton.

Hey Psychos!

You may know me as the guy that writes a the Daily Market Recap. Recently, I've been getting tons of questions asking me why I remain bullish even now. While I never discount market risks or volatility, I believe in the long-run the market (S&amp;P 500) still room to go higher. While the recap broadly covers these points, I want this post to more explicitly cover my reasons. As always, this is simply my humble opinion. This is not meant to be an in-depth post, just my top-line thoughts on the market. This is simply my humble opinion and I would love to hear yours.

**(1) People Overreact to QE Tapering**

Unfortunately, here on Reddit, there is a trove of misinformation spreading around regarding quantitative easing and the effects this has on the economy. To use a crude analogy, QE is like training wheels for a bike, they support you while you are learning, but are not needed once you learn to ride. In the same vein, during the height of the pandemic last year, when people were forced to quarantine and businesses were forced to close their doors, the regular flow of capital was severely disrupted. Therefore, the Fed passed QE measures to bolster, stimulate, and support the economy. Now, we are seeing consumer demand vastly outstrip supply and record growth in corporate earnings. While disruptions still exists stemming from the pandemic and now the surge in the Delta variant, the economy no longer needs its training wheels.

A very similar dynamic played out in 2013. During the 2008 housing collapse and recession, the Fed once again passed QE measures in order to support the economy. Fast forward to 2013 and the Fed decides it is time to taper QE given the economy had broadly recovered and the market absolutely lost its mind for a month or so. This just seems like history repeating itself, people put way too much emphasis on QE, the real test for equities IMO will be when the Fed discusses interest rate hikes.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp)

**(2) Pace of Corporate Earnings**

In Q2, 87% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 beat consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said âIn an earnings season with many surprises â including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history â one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470â.

**(3) Consumer Spending Yet to be Fully Unleashed**

Due to a variety of factors, including the surge in Delta variant and supply-side disruptions, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP has yet to be unleashed. Due to the multiple stimulus packages passed last year, many Americans have high levels of savings and are cash-rich but have not been able to exercise buying power due to pandemic-related factors. Once the Delta variant begins to recede (there are hopeful signs we have already crested the peak of the wave), I expect supply-side disruptions (which I will discuss more below) to ease up and allow consumer spending, which has been pent up for more than 18 months, to finally unleash.

Just today, the Commerce Department reported a 0.7% climb in sales last month came after a 1.8 percent decline in July and gains earlier in the summer. The gains in August, which were better than what economists expected, were prompted by a rise in spending on clothing, electronics, and furniture, and home goods.

**(4) Supply-Side Disruptions Mean Demand is Higher than Supply**

Nowadays, in order to physically produce goods to sell, companies rely on a truly global supply chain with many different links in vastly different geographical areas of the world. When the pandemic hit last year, essentially global supply chains were forced to suddenly stops, throwing a big wrench into the system. As the economy continued recovering and consumer demand starts picking up, restarting a global supply chain takes a lot of time and effort and continues to be disrupted by pandemic-related factors.

Sizeable gaps have emerged between factory orders and output. Transportation costs from China to Europe and the US have risen seven to 10 times in the past year. More companies in more sectors are supply-constrained. One particular facet you may be familiar with is the global semiconductor shortage, which has led auto-makers and electronic manufacturers across the world to raise prices and slash production capacity.

Moreover, the labor market remains deeply imbalanced, something that has only intesified during the recent surge in Delta variant cases.  Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, August employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous monthâs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, âWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what weâve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.â

Moreover, according to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans. I see no reason why the slack in the labor market won't start to quickly tighten once Delta variant concerns begin to dissipate, which again would serve to boost consumer spending.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3047169,public,self,Reasons I Remain Bullish,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ppikzl/reasons_i_remain_bullish/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'vOvdVsKwhGG87-qX2mKpSKN2qUTzj0gSgbudwsqXiKs', 'resolutions': [{'height': 69, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BYImkrVjXzSZ4zl7qvpLQlixwKTrx4DOtFWny9wO1ks.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcf59de8ae09cc355ecefdc4c3439e8624275a4f', 'width': 108}, {'height': 139, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BYImkrVjXzSZ4zl7qvpLQlixwKTrx4DOtFWny9wO1ks.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc88b9855b488d04b35657608d13274600c3b3ad', 'width': 216}, {'height': 207, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BYImkrVjXzSZ4zl7qvpLQlixwKTrx4DOtFWny9wO1ks.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=475bb73bb1612de38ad33ec80f07d36755103802', 'width': 320}, {'height': 414, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BYImkrVjXzSZ4zl7qvpLQlixwKTrx4DOtFWny9wO1ks.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569ba220728b70cbe8cf10ebf1e32f27f79866ae', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 440, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/BYImkrVjXzSZ4zl7qvpLQlixwKTrx4DOtFWny9wO1ks.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=2a86307aeafa74d4f13b4a36a65ee3735bbf5f24', 'width': 680}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

GME, 2.74% and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, 2.20%

âIf three hedge fund members work in concert to smash a short hedge fund, the 5 million Reddit people would say thatâs legal, but perhaps it shouldnât be,â Cramer said. âIf 5 million people decide to smash a hedge fund thatâs short, is that ok? Whatâs within the bounds of what you can do to smash a short seller?â

âPeople come on your show and they advocate either to buy or sell a security,â Gensler said. âBefore we had television, people did it on the radio, now we have various social media platforms. Thatâs not only free speech, but itâs part of what makes our capital markets robust, that people can disagree and disagree using the media of the day.

These companies are still trading at massive discounts to 2017 levels. That year was actually a period of financial and economic stress for many of them as well. Since then, many companies have dramatically reduced debt on the balance sheets by divesting assets and using free cash flow. Most reduced or eliminated dividends to do so. Now the commodity prices have recovered and there is a good probability that oil and natural gas prices continue to rise due to reductions in supply both in the US and globally as the majors pretend to go green. 

Oil &amp; Gas is 3% of the S&amp;P 500. The average since 1990 is about 9% with temporary highs of 15%. New energy companies are not being created so the change in weighting in the index is purely driven by investor sentiment which is driven by perceived fundamentals. We can argue about climate change and green energy all day long but the fact is our economy runs on petroleum-based fuels and products.  That is only going to change very slowly. The vast majority of chemicals and all plastics require oil and/or natural gas to produce. 

Oil &amp; gas producers hedge their price risk over 12-18 month cycles so they can better predict cash flows. Predictable cash flows allow the companies to budget capital expenditures for new oil &amp; gas production. This means that as prices rise in the short term, earnings do not change that much.  When prices enter a cyclical or supply-shortage driven uptrend, earnings and cash flow accelerate as the old hedge roll off and the companies hedge a little bit less because spot prices are high enough to more than generate the cash flow needed for growth. 

The rising commodity tide should lift most boats. Some company managements will screw things up by going on acquisition binges. Try and avoid these. Below I am going to list a bunch of companies that have good assets and good managements. Free cash flow yield for these companies should be 12% or greater over the next few years and much of that free cash flow should come back to shareholders as dividends or share buybacks as these companies have paid down much of their debt.

The analysts, led by John Murphy, praised Lucidâs LCID, 5.22% management team, its âkey competitive advantagesâ such as its Formula E technology, and its interesting/attractiveâ product, the Lucid Air ultra-luxury sedan. Lucid shares rose more than 4% on Wednesday, erasing some of their losses from earlier in the week, including a drop on Tuesday after analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated their coverage on the stock with the equivalent of a sell rating. 

Morgan Stanley said that Lucid was a âsuper premiumâ electric-vehicle maker that may be able to scale its production, but thereâs just too much competition to get too excited about the stock for now.

Lucid shares started trading on the Nasdaq in July after the companyâs merger with a blank-check company was approved on a second try a few days earlier. Lucid said at the time that it had $4.4 billion in funding and would be able to âsignificantlyâ accelerate its plan to deliver âthe worldâs best EVs.â The Newark, Calif., company hopes to start selling the Lucid Air, built at Lucidâs factory in Arizona, in the second half of this year. The car is expect to sell for about $77,000. The B. of A. analysts set a $30 price target on Lucid, which represents an upside of 52% over Wednesday prices. Lucid shares have nearly doubled this year, compared with gains of around 19% for the S&amp;P 500 index. SPX, -0.13%

The 14 are:

&amp;#x200B;

* **6G**:  âThe next generation of telecom networks will be needed in less than a  decade as data continues to grow exponentially and 5G reaches its upper  limit capacity.â
* **Brain Computer Interfaces**:  âAs we reach a point where humans are unable to keep up with computers  and AI, brain computer interfaces could help âlevel upâ humans with  computers. Shorter term, brain computer interfaces hold solutions for  paralyzed individuals and promise a new wave of innovation in gaming.â
* **Emotional Artificial Intelligence**:  Also âknown as 'Affective Computing' and 'Cognitive Computing' (it) is  designed to capture, analyze and respond to human emotions and simulate  human thoughts. EAI can potentially collect, analyze and respond to  completely new varieties of data and situations and predict or simulate  human thought, leading people to take action.â
* **Synthetic Biology**:  âAt its core, 'synbio', as the field is commonly referred to, takes  advantage of the vast diversity of nature to make biomolecules that  traditional chemistry cannot.â
* **Immortality**:  âTraditionally, aging has not been viewed as a disease that can be  treated but this is changing. Actors in this space are increasingly  looking to tackle the hallmark of aging via pathways such as genomic  instability, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular  senescence among others.â
* **Bionic humans**:  âThis could be invasive (e.g. implants) or non-invasive (e.g.  exoskeleton). Biohacking is also an associated field which is  essentially applying DIY biology to boost oneself e.g. RFID chip in hand  for contactless payments.â
* **eVTOL**:  âElectrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles that could provide an  alternative mobility transportation solution to outdated infrastructure  and overly stressed roads in urban settings.â
* **Wireless Electricity**:  âAs the IoT takes off, automating and creating near continuous charging  solutions could provide convenience for consumers, while solving  charging problems for the rollout of EVs and secure electricity supplies  for remote communities.â
* **Holograms**: âA  technology capable of creating a simulated environment through light  imagery projections that will allow everyone to come together in one  virtual room, without having to leave their physical location.â
* **Metaverse**:  âA future iteration of the Internet, made up of persistent, shared,  3D-shared spaces linked into a virtual universe. It could comprise  countless persistent virtual worlds that interoperate with one another,  as well as the physical world and transforming markets such as gaming,  retail, entertainment etc.â
* **Nextgen Batteries**:  âWhilst lithium batteries are the major EV technology, this does not  necessarily need to stay true with alternatives such as solid state,  vanadium flow, sodium ion etc provide promising additional attributes.â
* **OceanTech**:  âIt seeks to answer: âHow do we increase sustainability of the ocean  economy while harnessing its benefits?â Solutions could include ocean  energy, land based aquaculture, and precision fishing using AI.â
* **Green Mining**:  âTransitioning away from a carbon-intensive economy will mean moving to  a metal-intensive one. Green mining solutions like deep-sea mining,  agromining, mining of wastewater and asteroid mining could provide less  polluting and destructive solutions as the green economyâs thirst for  metals grows.â

I've made some posts about Vale, I am long and bullish on them and let me share my calculations and thesis. Please find errors.

Vale is the industry leader - quick intro

1. Conservatively finances ( 0.46 debt-to-equity, 196% current ratio)
2. Best ROE, ROIC and profit margins (lowest cost producer)
3. Management incentives and rewards are adequate, focusing on safety risks (dams)
4. Huge moat: geographically unique high quality and abundant iron ore deposits with very efficient vertical integration (railroad system, fleet of 170 vessels with long-term 30Y oil contracts), iron has been around since 1000 b.c (iron age) and a necessaity without substitution. Upside potential from nickel due to EVs, Vale 1st or 2nd largest nickel producer among other metals worldwide.

Numbers


A boom-bust cycle can be determined based on iron ore prices. A relative strong correlation is also measureable between the PPI and iron ore prices.

EBITDA/breakeven is $44.50/mt for Vale currently with production plans for 350 mt per year. Historically their EBITDA to FCF was 27.48% between 2005-2020 excluding 2015 and 2019 for the dam ruptures which were outlier events.

IO Depression price: mean - standard deviation : $65

IO Average price: mean $103

IO Boom price: mean + standard deviation $141



Based on historical cycles, I assumed 4 boom years, followed by one normal year and then 4 depression years, now 2021 is already a boom year which would only move the DCF value higher due 2021 has been enjoying high iron ore prices historically. 

$36.59 fair value for the decade. I would suggest to use a huge margin of safety, 2/3 would do, making even $23.1 a good entry long-term.

Shares outstanding: 4850 - post buyback program

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Perpetual Growth Rate: 2.5%

Their dividend history, as expected, has been irregular to say the least. Their free cashflows were low during the last boom cycle due to very high CAPEX spenditures. This will not happen again, since Vale's CEO (and other CEOs in the industry) are focusing value over volume , and are prepared better for an abrupt Chinese demand drop which caused huge troubles after the previous boom cycle with overspenditure in CAPEX.

Their dividend policy is pleasing - return as much value to shareholders as possible, all excess cash. 30% of EBITDA in regular dividends and excess cash in special dividends is the policy currently, and they have achieved this goal since their CEO's statement about this mindset in a 2017 report.

Macro environtment

China has played this card many times before, threatening to cut steel out put and going green but it is visible that they always fail to succeed due to growth pressures, nonetheless they pressure commodity prices to buy them up cheaper.

We can see a relative high (0.407) correlation between the PPI and iron ore prices. The reason to use the PPI instead the CPI is that PPI represents reality better, more honestly while the CPI is rigged (OER, quality adjustments) for government interest.

The US has been devaluing the USD to reduce the real debt burden on the government, as many countries did historically, and currently seems unable to meaningfully raise interest rates (the US has so much debt letting the rates raise to positive real rate area, above the CPI, 6-8% rates would be adequate at the least which would bankrupt the US), inflation seems to be the major theme for the coming decade.

Many emerging countries and companies have USD denominated debt which would erode due to inflation and help emerging markets like Brazil which is the largest South American economy and Vale. These countries could focus not only on exporting their resources but also to raise their living standards, build their infrastructures.

The study will enroll approximately 100 children aged up to and including 17 years at leading institutions across the United States and Denmark. The Study is expected to take 9-12 months to complete. If successful and upon approval by FDA of a supplemental New Drug Application for Byfavo, it is expected that the US label of Byfavo will be expanded to include moderate sedation for procedures in pediatric patients.

Dr Gabriel Fox, Chief Medical Officer, commented: âThe need for moderate sedation in pediatric patients is substantial, covering a wide range of procedures, including, but not limited to, MRI and CT imaging, endoscopies, intravenous cannula placements, dental procedures, and painful wound and burn dressing changes. We are excited to be working with an outstanding group of pediatric sedation experts on this important initiative.â

The Study, formally titled âA Phase 2/3, prospective, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of remimazolam for intravenous sedation in paediatric patients undergoing diagnostic and/or therapeutic proceduresâ (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04851717), underpins the Pediatric Study Plan for Byfavo agreed with FDA (as well as an equivalent plan agreed by co-sponsor PAION UK Ltd with the European Medicines Agency). As part of the US approval of Byfavo, FDA required the completion of the Study by July 2024; however, the Company has elected to accelerate the conduct of the Study significantly, because of the important unmet medical need for Byfavo in pediatric procedural sedation.

The network-equipment maker, which historically has gleaned most of its revenue from hardware, such as expensive switches and routers that buttress computer networks, also predicted sales from subscriptions will account for half of Ciscoâs revenue by fiscal 2025. To reflect its ongoing digital transformation, Cisco CSCO, -0.54% said it will start reporting two new metrics â annual recurring revenue and subscriptions as a percentage of total revenue â in November.

âWe are introducing new metrics because thatâs how investors need to think of us,â Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren told MarketWatch on the companyâs investor day Wednesday â its first in four years. He noted that 44% of Ciscoâs revenue this fiscal year came from subscriptions.

What is more, Cisco is revamping its current product categories, which are infrastructure platforms, applications and security, to five categories that better align with customer needs: secure, agile networks; hybrid work; end-to-end security; internet for the future; and optimized application experiences. The company will break out revenue for each in November. âWe have achieved metrics set four years ago, even through a pandemic,â said Herren, who added that investor day will return as an annual event.

Ciscoâs ongoing shift toward software and recurring revenue is the latest evidence of Chief Executive Chuck Robbinsâs overhaul of the Silicon Valley giant to a provider of hardware, software and subscription services as more companies demand hybrid-computing solutions. Indeed, during investor day, Robbins focused on the companyâs $16 billion in annual software sales, making it one of the top software vendors in the world. âWe were built for this moment,â he said. âThis is not a pivot. We have arrived and have delivered,â Robbins said. âAnd now we can continue to accelerate the software growth combined with world-class hardware.â

Ciscoâs four-year revenue forecast of 5% to 7% growth would far outstrip the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who expect it to crest at 6% in fiscal 2022 and then decelerate. Cisco shares are up 29% so far in 2021; the broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.85% is up 19% this year.

Over the past 18-ish months Iâve turned $50K into $1M by holding stock and leaps of Cloudflare, a powerhouse web infrastructure, CDN, and security company. 
While Iâm a big believer in the future of the company, Iâm gonna start winding things down and sell off the gains, (though I will wait until 2022 for 1/2 of it to save on taxes), because 1) the company is worth $40B and has revenue of only $630M this year, which makes it one of the most highly valued tech companies, and 2) Iâm concerned about a general market downturn fueled by inflation forcing the FED to raise interest rates etc.
Iâm obviously happy to have made money in the market, especially in this amount. Itâs just that Iâm kind of in the middle, Iâve made enough that itâs significant, but not enough to retire off of and forget about working, which has always been my aim. 
Also, Iâm not really able to share my success outside of my closest friends. Like I want my friends and family to know that Iâve âaccomplishedâ this, and itâs kind of like if I say it Iâm like a show off, but why is it showing off if Iâm just sharing what I consider to be the greatest accomplishment of my life.

In summary: I want to know if and how many shares a company is holding that could end up diluting the share price.

I do know that companies put offerings of more shares to a vote, sometimes well before they intend to do an offering simply to have the option available and others do them immediately. This is fine for companies I own stock of already cause I vote and keep tabs on it.

The issue is when I'm researching a new company or want to make a comparison. If its not a company I have historically followed, is there a clean and clear way to determine this?

I thought I was on to something when I stumbled on to the 3 headings below on a balance sheet but I still cant really make a conclusion from them.

$RSI, with it's market cap larger than both $SCR and $GNOG, may need a pretty sizable suitor to come knocking.

I am from scandinavia so my tax situation is a little differnt from USA. In short, I've got ~$2300 per year tax free in capital gains. The tax gain is in no way connected to my wage income. I am around 30 years old, I can take calculated risks.

I have most of my investments, apart from morgage, in long term native ETF's and the fee I pay for moving that around outweights my potensial tax advantage. The dividens in those ETF's is always reinvested.

Early this year I gained access to a foreign broker. While the spread isn't great, it's still nothing compered to the fees I pay at my bank. I have ~$5000 on that broker.

Therefore I wonder, is there anything I might be missing. The internet talks alot about long term vs short term capital gains. I am not bound by those. I could, in theory, swing trade more and use take advantage of my tax situation that way. But that has risks. I can barely clap my hands in a synchronized beat; I'd rather not count on my ability to time the market. There is also no such thing as ""wash sale rule"" in my country so I don't need to worry about that.

So far I've only seen 2 scenarios where this plays in my advantage:

i) I've try'd to spot very red days and sell only in order to rebuy in at a lower price the same day. This creates a tax event, meaning when I sell in the future my cost bases are higher. This feels kind of rough. I'd wish for a more sophisticated approach.

ii) I could invest in dividens company's. But I don't really understand the sweetspot between a dividens company that is groving and might compete with market gains vs a ""dinasaur"" (mature) company that's not gonna see much grow, something that's much more attractive to a investor who rely's on dividens as income. 

So my question is:

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 15, 2021**

Stocks steadily rose today, shaking off earlier losses and recent, driven mainly by the energy and industrial sectors, as market participants digested new economic numbers and the coronavirus situation in the US. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.83% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.73% higher, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.09%. Not surprised by this at all, I have been saying for months I remain bullish and have been buying on every dip until the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes.

The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, itâs likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.

The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.

In global news, new economic data coming out of China suggests the recovery in the second-largest economy is losing steam. Retail sales, a key gauge of Chinese consumer consumption rose just 2.5% year-over-year in August, a massive deceleration from the 8.5% YoY growth recorded in July and a sharply missing estimates of 7% growth. Separate data released Wednesday by the statistics bureau showed home sales by value falling by 19.7% in August from a year ago, the largest drop since April 2020âat the height of the pandemic.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) released a new generation of products, including the new iPhone 13
* US crude oil prices post rose sharply after the Energy Information Administration report that crude oil inventories declined by 6.4 million barrels last week amid pressure from Hurricane Ida, the lowest level since 2019
* US manufacturing production decelerated in August, likely due to disruption by Hurricane Ida and ongoing supply-side disruptions. The Federal Reserve's latest data showed manufacturing production rose by just 0.2% in August, or half the gain expected, based on Bloomberg consensus data. Production had risen by 1.6% in July. 
* EV-maker Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, hopes to raise as much as $8 billion in an upcoming US IPO.
* One of General Motors Co's China joint ventures said on Wednesday it is developing auto chips and aims to increase use of locally sourced chips in the next five years.
* Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook (FB), launched a test of an in-app business directory.
* Volvo is also gearing up for a $20 billion IPO in the coming weeks, according to Reuters. 
* Elon Musk-led SpaceXâs Inspiration4 rocket is scheduled to launch an all-civilian crew of four into orbit for three days on Wednesday, a mission that will be streamed live on Netflix (NFLX)
* **Sorry no price target upgrades, ran out of time**

On the 21st of June this year $TLSS entered into an agreement to purchase SalSon Logistics for the purchase price of $90 million. Using average EV/EBITDA multiples for the transportation and logistics sector in the US, and TLSS' current outstanding shares, I value SalSon to be around $.06 (330% the current share price of .0181) . Even without that valuation method and just using simple metrics, the current Market Cap for TLSS is 40M, so acquiring a company that makes 100M in revenue will send TLSS flying. This one acquisition will take TLSS from zero profit to millions of dollars worth of profit, and we have all seen the jump that stock prices have had once a company turns a profit. The acquisition deadline is planned for Sept. 13th, 2021 and is allowed a 15 day grace period to finalize if proof of secured financing is shown, so you should buy while you still can. It could be announced and any moment now.

Backstory

TLSS is a holding company with a strategy of buying profitable, well-managed companies and keeping their management in place. They build up the companies underneath them while adding more companies to the fold. This has been a very successful way of rebuilding the company and will continue to be successful going forward.

As for a little history, TLSS was once called PetroTerra and was set up by Lawrence Sands. Lawrence did some pretty fishy stuff, which would take a whole other post to list. The final straw was acquiring Prime EFS ""run"" by Frank Mazzola, a man with many SEC regulation lawsuits against him. I put run in quotations because technically he was not allowed to run a company due to the lawsuits against him, so his mother ""ran"" the company. Prime EFS eventually lost a contract from Amazon, which at the time was pretty much TLSS's only source of revenue. This is what caused the massive plunge down to a penny.

You may be saying to yourself ""That doesn't sound like a company I want to invest in"" and you would be completely right. However, the good news is that over the past couple of years TLSSâ new CEO, John Mercadante, has overseen an extremely successful restructuring.

Since the loss of the Amazon contract, he has been working on replacing the revenue lost from Amazon by acquiring other companies. He has also reduced debt by a substantial amount ($78M in Q2 2020 to $13M in Q2 2021). Some of this was reduced from the derivative liability because a bunch of note holders decided they wanted to hold shares. This is speculation, but they might be seeing some future potential in this company.

""Who is John Mercadante, and why is he important?""

John was the president and COO of COACH USA. He was one of the key members in growing COACH USA's annual revenues from $100M to $1B in three years. Before that he was the CEO of Cape Transit, one of the founding companies for COACH USA, and increased annual revenues from $2M to $11M. The man has decades of experience and knows what he is doing.

Within the past year TLSS has had a complete revamp. They acquired two companies, Double D Trucking and Cougar Express (*I don't know how they managed to find two companies with sexual innuendos and acquire them but they did), they got rid of the debt ridden subsidiaries ShypDirect and Prime EFS by using an Assignment for the Benefit of the Creditors, and most importantly, they lined up the acquisition agreement with SalSon Logistics.

Why SalSon is the fire that will light the TLSS rocket to the moon

There are multiple reasons why SalSon can make the TLSS stock price explode. The first is SalSonâs potential valuation. SalSon is estimated to make over $100M in revenue this year with an approximate $12M EBITDA. It is difficult to value exactly how much SalSon is worth as they are a private company, however, we can use EBITDA multiple averages for the logistics industry to get an estimate.

Using Google, the EV/EBIDTA multiple is around 12.96 for the 2021 year according to this site. I can't make any assumptions for SalSon debt or cash equivalents, but I think the fairest assumption would be that they are relatively equal therefore canceling each other out. EV = 12.96*12M = $155.52M. If you take that estimated market cap and use TLSS's current 2.6B outstanding shares, you get a price of around .06. The current price for TLSS is around .0181, so to get to .06 would be a 330% increase! I think itâs also fair to note that for high growth companies like TLSS the multiple is usually higher, so there is a good chance that we see even higher than .06. Past theories have suggested that companies with $100M annual revenues generally sit right under $1B valuations. If say a $900M valuation was the case, that would put TLSS at around $0.30 a share which would be incredible. However, I prefer to be more conservative and keep $.06 as the more likely valuation.

Another reason is that SalSon will make TLSS instantly profitable. In the latest quarterly report, TLSS had a loss of $1.5M after revenues and costs of business. Annualizing this would make $6M, so a $12M EBITDA would put the company in profit! You may feel that TLSS would just siphon money from the SalSon part of the business but thatâs not necessarily true. Shypdirect and Prime EFS were offloaded in the first week of September, so the associated costs and debts that they had will no longer be on the reports (They will still be on Q3 report but Will be gone by Q4). I canât value how much of the 1.5M loss is attributable to them, but I know that these subsidiaries were like a zombie virus infected arm that needed to be cut off and left to rot. At the very least TLSS should be close enough to break even that the entire $12M EBITDA will go right into the bank (after interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization costs of course).

Finally, acquiring SalSon will boost future growth through more acquisitions. TLSS mainly operates right now as a âlast mileâ shipping company. SalSon has many other avenues of logistics and transportation that will expand the possibilities of acquisitions for TLSS by making more companies easier to assimilate. This, along with the spread of locations that SalSon has across the east coast, makes acquiring smaller companies beyond more of a likelihood. TLSS wouldnât acquire a company in Georgia if most of the operations are run out of New Jersey, so after SalSon, Georgia and plenty of other states are within the scope of possibilities.

Terms of the Deal

TLSS will pay Mr. Anthony Berritto, Salson CEO, a 7.5 multiple of whatever the EBITDA of SalSon was for the year leading up to September. The estimation is $12M which means we will be paying a total of $90M for this acquisition. This will be split into three categories.

1. Mr. Berrito will receive 19.9% of the O/S, which is currently at 2.6B, to cover $20M of the acquisition costs. This will dilute shares some as it will increase O/S to 3.117B. I can hear the screams now, ""Oh No, Dilution Bad!"", and I would say that 99 out of 100 times you are right. In this case however diluting 20% of shares to increase share price by 300% or more will not be a problem. Even if you take the $155M market cap from earlier in the post and divide it by this new O/S, you still get a price of .05. I will take a 270% move any day of the year. Now if the cost of the 19.9% of shares offered does not fully cover the $20M, then the rest will be tacked onto the promissory note.
2. A $20M promissory note. This is the most variable part of the transaction. If any of the terms don't end up how they were estimated, then the remainder will be added to or subtracted from the promissory note. If EBITDA is more or less than $12M, the 19.9% of shares doesn't equal $20M, or if a little extra financing is needed, then this will be what changes accordingly.
3. A cash portion of $50M. This is the part that has some worried, however, reading from the 8-K it states "" The transaction is contingent upon the Companyâs ability to secure debt financing for the cash portion of the purchase price. The financing will be secured by the assets of SalSon, and it will likely rely exclusively on SalSonâs assets and financial performance."" The logistics and trucking industry has had a good year so I'm not worried that SalSon will be able to provide the necessary cash portion.

The deal is planned to close on Monday, September 13th with a 15-day grace period if more time is needed for the transfer of funds. The extension will only be allowed with proof of loan approval so an extension in this case would mean financing was secured.

I think a fair question to ask is ""Will the deal go through?"" Unfortunately, we have to make a leap of faith here, but I believe in the leadership of TLSS. Myself and other investors refuse to believe that John set up this huge deal without a way to close on it. I would also say most of the burden is on SalSon, which is a profitable logistics company. I feel they will have no problem financing their portion.

Why should I continue to invest after the SalSon deal closes?

First of all, I am not a financial advisor and your money is your money so do with it what you will. However, I have a recommendation with this stock that may be interesting.

We all understand the growth and potential that penny stocks have. They also come with a fair amount of risk. Taking money out to potentially invest in more penny stocks would not be the play in this case. With the fear and risk in the OTC market right now, you will most likely lose money (again your money do whatever you want with it).

In TLSS, you have a proven CEO that grows his companies with aggressive acquisitions who will now be in a small cap company instead of a micro cap company. TLSS will still be considered a ""growth"" company but with substantially less risk. He even states in the 8-K that SalSon will be a great ""foundational operation"" for TLSS meaning that he will continue to grow the company after the SalSon deal. I would assume with SalSon being heavy on the east coast that future acquisitions will slowly push operations into the center/west coast of the US (Texas would be huge). Seeing a company double over a year may not be as sexy as a 300% gain in a couple weeks, but doubling money on an already 300% gain is even sexier.

If that hasnât enticed you, think about the logistics industry as a whole. In the short term, you have prolonged COVID effects that have increased the revenues of almost every transportation and logistics business. In the long term, we could potentially be looking at self driving trucks, reducing both accidents and driving time. It will also probably reduce employee costs, but that will be countered with higher maintenance costs so that should be relatively net neutral. Getting into logistics is definitely a good call for a long term trade.

Conclusion

To reiterate, TLSS has had its ups and downs but has finally broke free from the past and should be seen as a new and upcoming company. It is no longer the company that was losing millions of dollars on an amazon contract only to eventually lose the contract anyway. It is a small logistics company run by John Mercadante who has been doing leading and growing companies since he started his first business in 1970. With the new acquisition, TLSS will expand operations down the entire east coast and will continue to grow at a fast pace. This will be a great long term hold!

LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Global equity index compiler MSCI is to start providing data on how much the world's top 10,000 firms are likely to be contributing to global warning.

The firm, which runs the widely-tracked $60 trillion All Country World Index, is launching Implied Temperature Rise scores, which estimate whether a firm's activities and plans are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

The idea is to get companies to change their strategies,"" said MSCI's head of ESG and Climate, Remy Briand, who estimates nearly 60% of firms still don't disclose even the most basic environmental data.

MSCI's new approach converts the current and projected greenhouse gas emissions, taking into consideration emissions reduction targets, of each company to an estimated rise in global temperature.

Projections are calculated by comparing those projected emissions with the global carbon budget that remains if the planet is to keep temperature rise this century below 2Â°C.

Briand laid out examples using two oil giants, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.

Exxon, which has been under heavy scrutiny for its approach to climate change, produces a 4C rise score - a scenario that scientists warn would lead to unprecedented heatwaves, severe droughts, and a major rise in sea levels and mass flooding.

Shell produces an implied 2C rise, having set targets to cut the carbon intensity of its products by at least 6% by 2023, by 20% by 2030, by 45% by 2035 and by 100% by 2050.

""The message is to make the commitment more public,"" Briand said.

His assumption is that because MSCI's indexes and data are used by most of the world's big investors, companies will need to have low implied temperature rise scores to encourage those money managers to park their cash in them.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3044860,public,self,"Equity index giant MSCI to give 10,000 firms global warming ratings",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pov9mp/equity_index_giant_msci_to_give_10000_firms/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'MdFv645wtpH_zNFT-WTtCInxpB2Q6gHJUVv69F5XDiY', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c454782706b4da7d873ec2b9c5a115825f36b37', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4a6ff3b1ca44c9a939222a3d41671561239e8e', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1d76af3676891097bb6d45cabbd4f951cd276ce', 'width': 320}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1007b1c1a2ce4b2136b4aa125997393e3117e0', 'width': 640}, {'height': 960, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6d473411f4a1ff06f3dc8f7ff5bd5af8691ee98', 'width': 960}, {'height': 1080, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee67fb309e5eef61ffb48a2270ebc68122bf944e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1200, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wqOSlV67UfIbFjA93a8nsIzQL-ZmyVzDsFtjSMbz0ok.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b7f2c770d6ff5785362e441038d60228d3b314cb', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

Someone told me that it is better to invest in the mining companies themselves over the stocks especially if I donât really have much knowledge on metals.

When I first invested, I decided to diversify and try to get the senior ones like FCX which is obviously a great value stock, with it being one of the bigger players in mining. Their stocks have risen 1.16% in premarket trading.

I also have some Anglo American, which is estimated to hold 898 million tonnes (Mt) of proven ore reserves, grading 0.58% of copper and containing 5,209 kilo tonne (Kt) of copper, as of December 2017. Their probable ore reserves were estimated to be 435Mt grading 0.54% of copper and containing 2.35Mt of copper.

There are also some juniors that I decided on, but I only got two since my goal is to diversify. One stock I got is from Lundin Gold. They are concentrated on the Fruta Del Norte gold mine in the country. There was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, but they recently announced the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.

I also decided to invest in Solaris Resources ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/)), which boasts their Warintza project and just released reports from their maiden drilling at El Trinche.

The proposed rules call for the removal of current sub-concession system, the appointment of  government delegates to oversee gaming operators and the creation of an illegal deposit crime, according to a macaubusiness.com report.

In 2002, Macau granted only three gaming concessions. One each to: SJM Resorts, a subsidiary of SJM Holdings; Wynn Resorts (Macao), a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts; and Galaxy Casino, connected to Galaxy Entertainment Group.


Local authorities eventually allowed each concessionaire to have a sub-concession. They included MGM China Holdings, Melco Resorts and Entertainment and Sands China.

The current concessions expire in June 2022. They can be extended by up to five years. But industry watchers say they're more likely to be extended by three years, since SJM and MGM have already had their concessions extended by two years to match up the expiry date of the other four concession holders.

Officials have not unveiled specific policies for review. But the number of future gaming concessions and their duration are in play. Authorities also propose more legal requirements for oversight of concessionaires, suitability evaluation, criminal responsibility and worker guarantees, among other things.


A public consultation for the new gaming law runs until Oct. 29.

Gambling makes up 80% of government revenues in Macau and 55.5% its GDP. Authorities are suggesting policies to reduce Macau's economic dependence on gaming. They're taking it a step further by saying that the gaming sector should take a leading role to drive that diversification.

Casino Stocks
Casino operators with a big presence in Macau are down sharply in Wednesday's stock market trading. Las Vegas Sands stock fell 7% before the open. On Tuesday, shares plunged nearly 10% to 38.71. LVS stock had been rebounding from pandemic lows and testing its 50-day line before the news broke Tuesday and tanked the stock, according to MarketSmith chart analysis.

Wynn stock dropped almost 8% in premarket trade. On Tuesday, Wynn Resorts skidded 11% to 92.25, below its 50-day line. Melco Resorts (MLCO) gave 8.5% early Wednesday. On Tuesday, MLCO stock gave up 5.9% to 11.95.

Meanwhile, MGM Resorts, which has less exposure to Macau, still retreated 3.5%. That's after losing 3.9% to 41.41 on Tuesday. MGM stock broke out past a 43.74 buy point from a cup-with-handle base intraday on Sept. 8. But the stock closed more than 6% below than entry..

With that said, there was nothing like that for UROY. Now, I'll be frankly honest, I didn't check the prospectus of the company (I didn't know individual companies even had prospectuses). I simply found the symbol after some due diligence into the main stakeholders, and the general business model and financials, and clicked buy. I don't necessarily regret it, because I'm sitting on a very nice return at this point.

I didn't however, know what a PFIC was until a few hours ago. In a panic, I did some research, and found the outlook is grim unless you can file with the company as a QEF the first year that you own it. No problem, this is the first year that I own it. Well, checking the prospectus (now that I know it exists):

&gt;Prospective investors who are US Holders should also be aware that, for each tax year, if any, that the Company is a PFIC, the Company may not satisfy the record-keeping requirements or make available to US Holders a PFIC annual information statement or any other information such US Holders require to make a âQEF Electionâ (as defined below in âCertain United States Federal Income Tax Considerationsâ) with respect to the Company or any subsidiary that also is classified as a PFIC. **Accordingly, it is expected that US Holders will not be able to make a QEF Election with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries.**

Well just great.

Now, I acknowledge that this is my own fault because it was me who missed the prospectus. Lesson learned.

But come on... I can't be the first, and sure as shit won't be the last to make this mistake. How many people will be buying this and selling it, without ever even knowing what a PFIC is? And most importantly, WHY IS IT LISTED ON A US EXCHANGE (the NASDAQ) IF THEY HAVE NO INTENTIONS ON ASSISTING PROSPECTIVE US INVESTORS FOR TAX PURPOSES?!?

Also, wasn't sure if I wanted to take the risk on a Chinese stock with all the daily CCP drama.

Then, on my way to work I was nearly cut off by a giant big rig, and guess what was on the side of the big rig? A big JD logo. Now, I'm in the USA, and it wasn't the ""actual"" JD company logo, but it was a giant big rig with the name JD on it, HUGE, right when I was literally thinking in my head whether I should take a chance on JD or not.

So, ended up buying JD that same morning, and a few days later I basically made like 8 or 9 percent on that play and it was pretty profitable, so that JD truck can run me off the road anytime, lol...

Here's another example...

I was eating some left overs at work from a plastic tray that I got from the restaurant the night before. As I was almost done eating, I noticed an interesting logo on the bottom of the tray. It just had a cool design. As I was about to throw it away, I took a quick look at it, and it said ""Clover"". Then, I go back to work, and I'm working on something, and the client lived on ""Clover lane"". Well, guess who did a CLOV daytrade that day and also made a nice profit!

OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play areâ¦

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 shutdown *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra dollars to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Belowâs a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I donât think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

Despite breaking a five-day losing streak yesterday, stocks once again fell today, with the three major indexes and the Russell 2000 (IWM) finishing firmly in the red as market participants digested new economic data and continue monitoring the coronavirus Delta variant situation in the US, which may finally be cresting.
The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, itâs likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.
The CPI report comes at a time when the marketâs attention is firmly focused on when the Fed will announce it will start scaling back pandemic-era quantitative easing. Powell has offered no signal beyond saying it âcould be this year.â Other members of the Fed have been more hawkish in their stance. As I have reiterated more times than I can count, I remain unconcerned with tapering talks (see the 2013 Taper Tantrum). I remain bullish until the Fed begins considering interest rate hikes, at which time I will reassess.
In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news.

 It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.â As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA).

- Yesterday, according to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Maâs Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the companyâs lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned. https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79
- Boeing (BA) raised long-0term demand forecasts today, signaling the company expects a snapback in commercial air travel once coronavirus Delta variant fears temper.
- Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed after Morgan Stanley released a report saying it was expecting a 10% dividend hike.
- China, the world's biggest vehicle market where regulators are implementing new rules on data protection, is developing machines that will be able to track data sent abroad by cars, a government-backed agency said on Tuesday.
- Last week, a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Appleâs 15-30% commission. This is massive for companies that make a lot of their revenue through the app store.
- A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday. The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which affects all versions of Apple's iOS, OSX, and watchOS. Apple confirmed the vulnerability and said the issue has been fixed in todayâs software update.

As much is established with the word âmillennialâ being mentioned 15 times in their business section of the most recent 10-K form. Even the opening line to this section has Revolve Group themselves highlighting the fact that they are geared towards the millennial/gen-z market. But how realistic is this story for Revolve Group? I have some skepticism and here is why. 


**Pricing**
Shein, Fashion Nova, Oh Polly, and Hottie are all big players in the current blazing hot social media clothing market. This is ofcourse where a Lionshare of the millennial customers actively find their clothing items to match with current trends. Yet, Mike Karainkolas, Revolve Group Co-Ceo, said in a Piper Sandler webcast that they donât view those companies as direct competitors. Infact, they view them as âadditional playersâ in the fact that they are all biting off what he calls the âlegacy playersâ, that is the Kohls (KSS) and Nordstrom's (JWN) of the world. He claims that the price point of Revolve products along with the quality place them above the aforementioned companies, saying himself that Revolve markets premium products for millennials. The problem is, how many millennials have the budget to afford âpremium productsâ when most are interested in the attractive prices from say, a company like Fashion Nova that constantly runs blowout sales. What does the premium product grant as an advantage to attracting millennial customers? Unfortunately Revolve doesnât source desegregated financial information beyond the typical geographic data, so we can't see the demographics of customers that Revolve is attracting. We must just take their word that they are attracting millennial customers. It is very possible that Revolve is attracting customers away from Nordstrom with glitz and glam styles at the same price point, which accounts for their 600-million-dollar revenue stream. Perhaps they are even attracting a large crowd of people who are attempting to rejuvenate their styles by looking younger. But ultimately my contention is that it seems very unlikely that Revolve is competitive at all in the Millennial customer space, and that they are simply using this as a buzz word to attract new investors. 


**Marketing** 
Digital marketing with an emphasis on millennials is the primary strategy for future growth for Revolve, and while it might seem that I am harping on the topic of millennials excessively, it is important to note that Revolve themselves have highlighted this as their best pure path for growth and a driving force for convincing potential investors to invest. Mike Karainkolas himself said that they are seeing âpositive resultsâ from TikTok. Revolve was even hosting its own festival, the âRevolve Festivalâ which in 2019 caused quite a buzz on Instagram with major celebrities attending the private event. But beyond these two intriguing developments, I have been hard-pressed in uncovering a meaningful digital footprint. While companies like Monster Energy (MNST) release presentations highlighting their engagement efforts with empirical data and even place brand ambassadors on several slides, Revolve does nothing of the sort. Infact, I couldnât find social media engagement numbers mentioned anywhere on the official Investor Relations website. For a company whose biggest marketing opportunity lies in social media, you would expect some basic engagement statistics at the very least. This is something of major note as Revolve claims to be a key player in digital marketing.  

**Conclusion**
Because of the reasons listed here, my valuation for Revolve included a much smaller growth rate than the company itself expected. I am a pure value investor and a one man show with a small portfolio. I value hundreds of companies and as such, donât spend an excessive amount of time researching a firm. With that said, I admittedly only spent a couple hours looking at Revovle before deciding it wasnât worth extensive research beyond what I did for this post. Will Revolve ultimately capture the interests of millennials?

Last week, [Forbes reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/general-motors-selects-cepton-to-supply-lidar-for-2023-production/) that GM has selected Cepton to be its lidar supplier for upcoming cars produced in 2023 - 2027. The lidar space is quite full of names nowadays, but Cepton isn't usually one you hear. So why would GM select them?

First off, SWAP-c. What is SWAP-c?

**S**ize**W**eight**a**nd **P**ower-**C**ost

Cepton's nova lidar is &lt;$100 while being ultra-compact and low-power. The small form factor lets automotive manufacturers place the lidar in a variety of places:

* [behind the windshield](https://i.imgur.com/IomKLYB.png)
* [in headlamps](https://i.imgur.com/sbLVTh0.png)
* [in fascias](https://i.imgur.com/kH2lXQi.png)

The competitive price is simply too good.

Cepton has partnered with a key tier 1 automotive parts supplier, Koito. This makes Cepton VERY attractive to OEMs, as Koito will definitely be able to mass-produce &amp; integrate Cepton's lidars. Oh, did I mention Koito is the #1 global headlamp supplier?

The ability to mass-produce the units while maintaining automotive grade is very difficult. You constantly see lidar companies showing off prototypes, but top OEMs like Toyota and GM want reliability and scalability.

As taken from [this article](https://groundtruthautonomy.com/suddenly-everyone-is-talking-about-lidar-here-are-10-things-you-need-to-know/)

&gt;To be blunt, making lidar units is hard; mass producing them is even harder. Automakers need lidar units that are automotive grade and meet the exacting requirements of self-driving system developers. They also require a manufacturing and supply chain capable of supporting high-volume production. From R&amp;D to manufacturing, supply, and after-sales support, lidar manufacturers need to demonstrate that they can consistently produce low runs of lidar prototypes and high volumes of commercial operation-ready lidar units to a growing number of markets globally. A lidar unit includes optics, electronics, and microscopic mechanical components. With the technology in its infancy, and with no longevity of experience to turn to, very few manufacturers have the required combination of manufacturing skills, or the ability to competitively produce at high volumes. Automakers and self-driving vehicle companies will look to those suppliers that can reliably produce cutting-edge technology at a reasonable cost.

Let's not forget performance as a factor.

I can think of only a few special circumstances where this makes sense:

1 - You want monthly income and don't care about too much growth. I don't even know how to test this, but since the CAGR on SPY is higher, wouldn't you be able to still do better than QYLD even selling a stock here or there? The only thing I can think of is if you are forced to sell stocks in a bear market.

2 - Depending on account tax status, you eventually will want to switch your money into QYLD for retirement, so it's better to DRIP QYLD for 30 years than sell SPY after 30 years, take a huge hit on tax, then buy QYLD.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I have ZERO market experience but a big opportunity. Google can only explain so much, I need your knowledge. Mind you, I am still googling away every day to try and start learning about this.

I bought into a first round private crowd funded company at 10m valuation. They may be going public at 100m. I bought 20,000 shares at 12 cents.

Large industry and valuation is expected to add another zero within 5 years.

First, what, if anything, do I need to do? I donât want to end up in a situation where my ânoteâ isnât converted to stock. I WANT THE STOCK, and I donât want them sending me principle and interest back. I read something in the contract that sounds like that may happen if I do or donât do something?

I read something about exercising pre or post IPO? Does this apply to my type of note? I thought exercising was converting to cash. I donât want to âexerciseâ, do I?

Is there any way to make more profit on this (long term) than just holding? I have zero market experience, but feel like this could be life changing?

What happens if the company decides not to go public by the maturity date? Can I continue to hold my stock or is it automatically converted/exercised and the cash value is sent to me? Or is this maturity date when the note is converted to commons stock?

If the company issues equity securities (âEquity Securitiesâ) in a registered offering, or offering qualified under Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933 (a âQualified Financingâ), then the Notes, and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, will automatically convert into the equity securities issued pursuant to the Qualified Financing at a conversion price equal to 75% of the per share price paid by the purchasers of such equity securities in the Qualified Financing. Holders covenant to execute any investments or rights agreements required as part of the Qualified Financing.

Repayment at Maturity Date or Voluntary Conversion:

If the Notes have not been previously converted pursuant to a Qualified Financing, then, effective upon the Maturity Date, the Holders will have the right to repayment of any outstanding principal and accredited interest. Alternatively, Holders may elect to convert their Notes into Common Stock of the company at a price announced by the company at least 30 days prior to the Maturity Date.

Sale of the Company:

If a Qualified Financing has not occurred and the company elects to consummate a sale of the company prior to the Maturity Date, then (i) the company will give the Investors at least five days prior written notice of the anticipated closing date of such sale of the company and (ii) the company will pay the holder of each Note an aggregate amount equal to 1.5 times the aggregate amount of principal and interest then outstanding under such Note.

Pre-Payment:

The principal and accrued interest may not be prepaid unless approved in writing by Investors holding Notes whose aggregate principal amount represents a majority of the outstanding principal amount of all then-outstanding Notes (the âRequisite Holdersâ).

Amendment and Waiver:

The Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes may be amended, or any term thereof waived, upon the written consent of the company and the Requisite Holders.

No Security Interest:

The Notes will be a general unsecured obligation of the company, subordinated to any current or future debts of the company.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3041503,public,self,Terms of Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note and IPOâs.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 13, 2021**

*My bad for the late post, I had the recap written and sent it out, just forgot to post it here. Apologies*

After being negative through most of the day, the three major indexes reversed in the last hour of the market in order to snap a five-day consecutive losing streak, the longest since February. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.25% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed even while the Dow Jones (DIA) broke its recent streak of relative underperformance to close 0.74% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 0.58% higher. 

Last week, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, âAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this wonât be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind weâre still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.â

In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news. It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.â  As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA). 

Shares of Chinese companies were broadly lower again as the regulatory crackdown by the CCP continues. According to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Maâs Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the companyâs lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned.[ https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79](https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79)

Looking ahead, market participants are closely eyeing new reports on inflation and consumer spending set to be released next week. The former will be monitored to signal whether upward price pressures during the recovery have extended further and whether the Federal Reserve may need to step in sooner rather than later to stave off a lasting jump in inflation. Consensus economists expect Tuesday's consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 5.3% in August over last year, pulling back from July's more than a decade-high annual rise of 5.4%. 

The new data on August retail sales out from the Commerce Department later this week will also offer a look at how consumer spending has held up amid concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Overall retail sales are expected to drop by 0.8% in August in Thursday's report, extending July's 1.1% decline. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

**Highlights**

* House Democrats released details of a plan that intends to help pay for the $3.5 trillion 2021 spending bill currently in consideration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., on Monday released details of plan that includes increasing the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%, up from the current rate of 21%, and restoring the top rate to 39.6% for individuals earning over $400,000 and married couples earning over $450,000. In order for the bill to pass and avoid the filibuster, Democrats are using special budget rules but need all 50 Democratic Senators and virtually all other House Democrats to agree. 
* In more news coming out of China, regulators ordered the largest internet companies to stop blocking links from rivals on their apps, another step designed to increase competition among tech companies. Authorities have made the move against blocking external links a key focus of a campaign that started in July, after receiving multiple complaints from users, an official with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.
* Last week, a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Appleâs 15-30% commission. This is massive for companies that make a lot of their revenue through the app store.
* A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday. The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which affects all versions of Apple's iOS, OSX, and watchOS. Apple confirmed the vulnerability and said the issue has been fixed in todayâs software update. 
* ViacomCBS (VIAC) will be restructuring Paramount Pictures amid a broader management shake-up, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The realignment will see Paramount focus primarily on making content for sister cable and streaming networks. 
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

Due to several factors (CO2 quotas, high dependency to new renewables + no wind currently, high competition with Asia, inventories historically low especially in Germany and Netherlands, many gas powered projects made in the last years, etc.) the prices for natural gas &amp; electricity are currently skyrocketing like crazy.

For the MWh of gaz we went from \~14 EUR to \~57 EUR for the october futures.

[https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futures/data?marketId=5285052&amp;span=3](https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futures/data?marketId=5285052&amp;span=3)

In the UK, over the last decade (2010-2020), the MWh of electricity vas about Â£45. It is currently around Â£354. 

Gas &amp; electricity are of course used in many processes. These are also absolutely vital for domestic heating (and we are still in late summer here). The inflation we will see, if those prices stay in the mid-long term, is feared to be really high (as those prices impact every level of the society: production, heating at home, the supermarket fridges,...) . The probability this trend could last is really low. It is nearly sure that a correction will somehow happen in Europe because of that supply crunch and the    
impoverishment it will cause. Not a lot of politicians are currently talking of that problem so far and it's hard to know if most of them are aware of it (a lot of the current discussions still revolve around covid, etc). However there are already reports of a few manifestations in Spain.

Even if that trend is not viable in the long term, it is not going to stop in the short term seeing the level of the German &amp; Netherland gas reserve.

This was originally posted on r/BurryEdge. It was written by u/thesuperspy .

**COMPANY OVERVIEW**

Scorpio Tankers, and its subsidiaries, transport refined petroleum products worldwide. They are a product tanker operator meaning they transport refined oil products (e.g. gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, etc.), as opposed to an oil tanker operator which transports crude oil.

As of 8 September, 2021, Scorpio owned, finance leased, or bareboat chartered 131 product tankers, which included 42 Long Range 2 (LR2), 12 Long Range 1 (LR1), 63 Medium Range (MR), and 14 Handymax tankers with an average age of approximately 5.6 years, making it the youngest and most modern fleet in the industry.

\--

**MISPRICING**

At a current market cap of just under $1B STNG is trading at roughly 50% below its book value. The market has underpriced STNG because of three primary factors:

1. COVID induced floating storage demand
2. A COVID induced 20-year low in daily tanker rates
3. A lot of debt that the company can handle

The first factor, floating storage demand, prevented Scorpio from leveraging its advantage as the youngest ECO product tanker fleet in the industry.

The COVID shutdowns caused global demand for oil based products to rapidly decline. Supply outstripped demand and land based storage facilities filled up quickly. The lack of land based storage led to ships being contracted as floating storage, where Scorpio has no advantage because **a leaky twenty year old rust bucket with no engine can fill up its tanks and do nothing just as effectively as a brand new ECO tanker**.

Floating storage demand has prevented Scorpio from realizing its advantage as the youngest ECO product tanker fleet in the world

Floating storage demand has been on a steady return to normal throughout 2021, meaning product tankers are returning to their routes. Scorpio will leverage its industry advantages as product tanker demand increases in 2022 and 2023, but the market hasnât priced this in yet.

\--

**FINANCIAL HEALTH SUMMARY**

**PROS**

* Assets more than cover long term liabilities ($4.82B vs. $2.73B)
* Debt-to-Equity ratio reduced from 125% to 54% since 2018
* FCF growing around 62% since 2016
* Enough cash flow to operate for another three years

**CONS**

* Not yet profitable
* Debt-to-Equity ratio still high at 54%

**CONCERNS**

* Continues to pay a dividend while not yet profitable  

   * Forecasted to be about \~12% of earnings in 2024
   * Earnings should be able to cover current dividend rate through 2024

**This isnât a detailed financial analysis.** All we need to know for this thesis is that Scorpio has enough assets to continue operations until market demand increases and Scorpio can leverage its advantages as the youngest ECO product tanker fleet operator.

\--

**THE MODERN FLEET ADVANTAGE**

**Fuel Cost Advantage**

On 2 January 2020, just before COVID strangled world economies, [new regulations limiting sulphur content in ship fuel oil came into force.](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Sulphur-2020.aspx) This new regulation limited all ships without exhaust scrubbers to only use Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) containing 0.5% or less sulphur by mass as opposed to High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO) containing 3.5% sulphur by mass. This nearly doubled the cost spread between VLSFO and HFSO in January 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse in oil price quickly narrowed the spread.

The price of VLSFO was nearly double the price of HSFO prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and is still around $100 more expensive in September 2021. Source: Ship &amp; Bunker

The VLSFO/HSFO spread quickly narrowed in January 2020 but has maintained an average spread of about $100 per metric ton (mt) in 2020 and 2021. This means ships with scrubbers still have about a 17% fuel cost advantage over ships without them, and that advantage is likely to increase with growth in shipping demand (e.g. economies opening back up) or an increase in oil price (e.g. increased oil demand and/or increased inflation). So how much advantage does STNG have compared to other product tanker fleets? 

&amp;#x200B;

||Ships (EOY 2019)|Ships (May 2021)|Tonnage (May 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Global Product Tanker Fleet|UNK|4%|14%|
|STNG Product Tanker Fleet|58%|84%|82%|

A lot

Scorpio also benefits from having a 100% ECO product tanker fleet. ECO tankers are more fuel efficient through the use of modern engines, improved hull designs, and other efficiency improvements. While Scorpioâs fleet is 100% ECO the majority of the global fleet is not. This enables Scorpio tankers to leverage additional fuel cost savings beyond the global fleet average. The combination of high scrubber installations in a modern ECO fleet will be a major factor in Scorpioâs pricing advantage as shipping demand increases.

Scorpio operates a 100% ECO fleet while the industry as a whole is well below 50%. Source: Scorpio Tankers Inc Company Presentation September 2021

\--

**Fleet Age Advantage**

Scorpio will have a significant pricing advantage in the coming years due to the age of its fleet.

[According to Euronav](https://www.euronav.com/media/65361/special-report-2017-eng.pdf), the overall life of a tanker vessel is 20-25 years. [A quarter of the global fleet will be over 20 years old within the next 15 months](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/one-quarter-of-tanker-fleet-to-be-over-20-years-old-by-2023/).

More importantly for Scorpio, some product ship charterers consider it too risky to contract ships older than 15 years. 38% of the current global product tanker fleet (863 vessels) is over 15 years old, and 81% of the current global fleet (1,819 vessels) will be over 15 years old within the next five years, with the majority hitting this mark by EOY 2024.

Over 80% of the current global product tanker fleet will be over 15 years old in 2026

The average Scorpio tanker is 5.6 years old and will not reach 15 years old until 2030.

This information is slightly outdated as the BW/Hafnia merger now operates a 203 vessel fleet, but Scorpioâs fleet is still younger. Source: Scorpio Tankers Inc Company Presentation September 2021

But wonât other operators just build more ships to replace their aging fleet? Right now the answer is âNoâ.

\--

**Tanker Supply is Shrinking**

Low daily tanker rates, high construction costs, and high scrap metal returns are driving down tanker supply, and may lead to a significant industry over correction that will drive daily rates higher.

[Product tankers are being demolished at a record pace](https://www.bimco.org/news/market_analysis/2021/20210511-oilprodtankerdemotohit11y-high) and very few new ones are being built to fill the hole theyâre leaving in the tanker supply. Product tanker daily rates are below operating costs, and scrap metal prices are sky high. This combination makes it very tempting to pocket $8M by scrapping a 20 year old fully depreciated tanker whose original cost was $35M.

Returns for scrapping old tankers are the highest they have been in years

This combination of low daily rates, aging fleets, higher fuel costs due to regulations, and record prices for scrap metal is contributing to **record levels of Product Tanker Scrapping.**

Orders to construct new ships are also at all-time lows.

Orders for new product tankers are at near record lows

Current orders will replace 6.7% of fleet capacity while an average of over 8% of the global fleet will become 15 years old each year over the next five years. Newbuilds simply arenât replacing the lost capacity, and they're definitely not replacing capacity for charters of ships less than 15 years old.

MR vessels, the same class seeing record demolitions, are not being replaced fast enough to keep up with the number of ships being scrapped

Product Tanker newbuild orders also arenât likely to increase soon due to the low daily rates combined with the rising cost in ship construction. It is simply too risky to order new vessel construction in this environment.

30% of vessel construction cost is steel and steel prices have dramatically increased in 2H2021

\--

**BEAR CASE**

* We are past peak oil and demand will never be what it was prior to 2019
* Inflation is transitory and we wonât see an inflation driven rise in oil prices
* Inflation is transitory and ship construction costs will settle down to a point where the industry will build more if justified by demand

\--

**TL;DR:** Scorpioâs investment in a 100% ECO fleet since 2015, and use of the 2020 lull to install more scrubbers, has positioned the company to dominate future product tanker route pricing as inflation raises oil costs and oil product demand rises in 2022 and beyond. At 50% of book value STNG is an excellent value with a reasonable margin of safety due to the ability to continue to operate at a loss on current assets and cashflow. The value increases significantly if inflation is here to stay.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3040678,public,self,Michael Burry 13-F Breakdown: STNG (An Undervalued Opportunity in a Cyclical Industry Thatâs Overcorrecting Supply),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pnmt0e/michael_burry_13f_breakdown_stng_an_undervalued/,all_ads,6,,1235582c-6848-11eb-96e8-0e132357f477,Company Analysis,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Nk9GWY7eiSXG3Sjj66xLXTvZBQfYZpT9IPv2aaMshVo', 'resolutions': [{'height': 76, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8d041701e15dccb96c86f93bfaaef4d40f8be08', 'width': 108}, {'height': 152, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f181bd19725e9db3cd4adfe610c12e69e3600fb2', 'width': 216}, {'height': 226, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21e8966b39426d8246844eea12fe87144483b3bb', 'width': 320}, {'height': 452, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c081e34da6a7d4fad5f0b50fb3d86f65ab0806b9', 'width': 640}, {'height': 679, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d763b6ad0f71f8f4f3c3e4c955b1066e9f2de5d1', 'width': 960}, {'height': 763, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcf5474739e65a6dd2bc1b2d0d9a1f88718dd5b4', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1189, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cBDDg5k7e0QX1ZV-5z9bKdT8hiE-U3wzGR4OQAqHzHA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=cfe0bd6a9223e82dbe6bea5dd1ee447c18bf543c', 'width': 1681}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

Let's start the week off right!

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* NVAX
* ASAN
* LYFT
* DELL
* AMC
* RGNX

Gapping DOWN:

* BABA
* BILI
* AVTR
* UVXY

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher after another choppy trading session on Friday. Fears over regulatory scrutiny in China continue, as the Financial Times reported that Beijing was looking to break up financial tech company Alipay. BABA and other Chinese stocks are trading lower in premarket, as a result. We should be getting more inflation numbers in this week, and this will be important to monitor, as it could affect how/when the Fed steps in. The August consumer price index (CPI) should be reported on Tuesday. We have been seeing some supply chain issues around the world, and this will likely apply upwards pressure on inflation numbers, at least in the short-term. Retail sales are expected to drop once again, we'll see if they're in line with analyst estimates. I think we could see some more volatility in the coming days.Â 

SPY is trading right around 448, and we could be in for another choppiness today. If we can't hold up over 448 support, we could see some more selling off. DIA is trading a bit under 349. 348 will be a support level to watch, but we could hold up after a bounce off the SMA(100) in Friday's trading. I'll be watching price action around that level. QQQÂ isÂ trading a bit over 378 and is hovering between support and resistance. If we continue to see weakness, it could test 375 as support. If it sees strength, it could test 380 as resistance. Gold is trading flat, silver is slightly in the red, and crude oil is up and back over $70/barrel. B\*\*coin saw some more weakness over the weekend and is currently trading around 44,700. Things are looking bearish at the moment, but that could always change. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are trading a bit lower in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks saw choppy sessions on Friday, and are looking bearish unless we see some strength in the near future. Meme stocks are up a bit in premarket trading, worth keeping an eye on. AMC's daily chart in particular looks good, I'll be watching for more strength.Â 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

Rogers admittedly finds âno basisâ for the specific 30 percent rate, despite Apple hiring a consultant to testify about the value of its patents. (As mentioned previously, the ruling is full of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort, and requiring developers to use Appleâs payment system âaccomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.â

Epicâs unbundling alternative, meanwhile, would âseverely undermineâ the system, says the ruling. âIndeed, to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform, such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.â

Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system, âApple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,â Rogers writes. 

End of quotes.

The judge clearly states that Apple deserves compensation for hosting an App even if payment is made outside the App store.

I have seen Up Fintech (TIGR) covered just a few times in several months but since they had a very good earnings report this past Friday I think it is important to have a review.

TIGR is based in China but also has other arms in East Asia, Singapore as well. They grew sales the 1st quarter at 250% and made a profit, and this 2nd quarter 100% and lost 2.5 cents. They are actually growing much faster than any US broker, including Robinhood and are going to make some serious profits far sooner!!! If your gripe is it being a Chinese company, and you do not want to invest, I understand, but do keep in mind this stock has been crushed with BABA, DIDI and the likeâ¦.Also, this loss was due to add spending which increased from 2.8 million to 24 million but growing accounts by more than 300%!! 

Actually, this was $25 a share April/May before Archegos debacle and then Chinse fall outâ¦ .this crashed under 13 as wellâ¦.Then when they crushed earnings this went from 12-30 in a few weeks! This was trading around 23-24â¦.Goldman Sachs actually put a sell rating with a target of $21â¦.. It started to come downâ¦. DIDI Ipoed in the US, on a Wednesday and that weekend China came down on DIDI hardâ¦. Everything ADR even CPNG fell like a brick. They have not recovered since.

What you should ask yourself is what a company is worth that is growing sales at 100%, grew accounts by 300% and stands to make between .50-.75 cents. Generally speaking with this type of growth it is easy to say that a 50x PE ratio can be givenâ¦ Take 50 cents x 50 and that is 25 dollarsâ¦..

Some highlights from the most recent report. You also check last report of 250%! Growth!!! But I know this market is what have you done for me lately, so I will touch on this past quarter.

During the second quarter, the total number of funded accounts increased to 529,100. The Company added more funded accounts in the first six months of 2021 than it did in its entire cumulative operating history. The total account balance increased 188.9% year-over-year to US$23.9 billion as the Company continued to attract new clients from multiple international markets. In Singapore, UP Fintech's local subsidiary, Tiger Brokers (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., launched new products and in-APP functions such as an industry heatmap, Mini USD/CNH futures, and OSE futures, supplementing the wide range of analytical tools and securities trading functions available on the Company's platform.

We added 153,100 funded accounts in the second quarter, an increase of 353.5% year over year and 30.4% quarter over quarter; of these newly acquired accounts, over 60% came from international markets. Total account balance reached US$23.9 billion despite challenging market conditions, nearly triple that of the same period last year and 11.8% increase from the first quarter of this year.

Total revenues were US$60.2 million, a 98.7% increase from the second quarter of 2020. We increased investment in self clearing, user acquisition and talent recruiting, which are essential to our future growth, which resulted in increasing operating costs and expenses compared to same quarter last year.

Outside of this being an ADR, I am not sure why anyone would be negative on it.

Just give me whatever I can use in the future (near or far) to boost my income.

**Bullish for following reasons**

**1.** Stock is categorized as Momentum stock- with enough volume, it will break $4 resistance

**a.** 9/24 Earning calls event could be the much needed catalyst to keep the volume moving giving it needed momentum in upward moment next 1- 2 weeks.

**2.** 100% buy rating from 9 analysts

**3.** No negative news and firm is aggressively building partnerships and collaborations with industry leaders meanwhile also hiring/expanding their leadership team

**4.** High PT of 36.75 and low PT of $8 with average of $16 (https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AGTC)

$SLQT : Founded in 1985, SelectQuote (NYSE: SLQT) provides solutions that help consumers protect their most valuable assets: their families, health and property. The company pioneered the direct-to-consumer model of providing unbiased comparisons from multiple, highly-rated insurance companies allowing consumers to choose the policy and terms that best meet their unique needs. Two foundational pillars underpin SelectQuote's success: a force of more than 1,000 highly-trained and skilled agents who provide a consultative needs analysis for every consumer, and proprietary technology that sources, scores, and routes high-quality sales leads. The company has three core business lines: SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Life and SelectQuote Auto and Home. SelectQuote Senior, the largest and fastest-growing business, serves the needs of a demographic that sees 10,000 people turn 65 each day with a range of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans from 15 leading, nationally-recognized carriers, as well as prescription drug plan, dental, vision and hearing plans.

**P.S:** Wrote this on WSB on Thursday and it was already correcting on Friday with **5% increase.** I expected it go up quicker. Options premiums are extremely cheaper for now making it still a great play but in short term and long term.

**Updates &amp; Pros**

**1.** **Insider buying was at 4 Million** in one week right after the big drop 2 weeks ago.

**2.** Stock is showing consistent price increase and is up by **72% (from 7.6 to 13.05)** since my DD

**3.** Current buy rating is 89% with **High PT of $39** and lowest of $13 with median of $27.5 ( [https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=SLQT#:\~:text=Stock%20Price%20Forecast,the%20last%20price%20of%2014.31](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=SLQT#:~:text=Stock%20Price%20Forecast,the%20last%20price%20of%2014.31).)

**4.** Just last month (August) **21% or so SI increase** and new rules around margin requirements in September can even speed up recovery. 

**5.** Options premium are some of the cheapest ones if one is interested in it

**6.** SLQT as a business have competitive advantage and at least decade more experience in the industry in comparison to its competitors including GOCO- reason why I chose SLTQ instead of GOCO

**7.** Currently it has entered a resistance level and once broke, it will be testing $17, then $19. Using both quantitative &amp; qualitative analysis, I expect the stock to go in 20s range in next 2-3 weeks (https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/SLQT/technical-analysis)

**8.** The **biggest catalyst that can push SLQT to 30s range or even higher** is Enrollment Period of October November (Keep in mind that SLQT targets a market where more than 75% of target group uses this platform)

**9.** I personally believe that even highest price target is very low and it should trade in $50s soon (I work in healthcare industry as consultant and keeping up with trends is how I make living)

This Stock caught my eye today when it dropped by 45% due to 0.02 EPS report in comparison to 0.04 expected.

SelectQuote's q**uarterly revenue was up 33.2%** compared to the same quarter last year. 

**Blackrock and Vanguard** are the top shareholders

SelectQuote has a **market capitalization of $1.29 billion** and generates $531.52 million in revenue each year. The company earns **$81.15 million in net income (profit)** each year or ($0.16) on an earnings per share basis

Hello investors,

In this memo, I wanted to talk about how to pick the right options.

I've seen many videos that talk about options, like making monthly income through selling options. While these are great points, I wanted to start from a more fundamental standpoint and understand options from a broader level.

I'm also going to skip the definitions of calls and put options for simplicity purposes.

I think the basics of options can be learned better through reading pages like Investopedia.

Options are mainly used by professionals to hedge their positions. For example, if you have positions in DIS, and you think DIS stock will plummet in the near term, you want to protect your stocks by buying put options.

There's also a very popular strategy, often used by Warren Buffett as well, where you sell covered puts so that you can buy expensive stocks at cheaper levels. I will be covering these in future memos so make sure to follow Midasinvestors if you'd like to see those.

In this memo, I will be covering which call options to buy when you are confident in the stock's price movement.

For example, if you want to buy a call option on a stock because you think the stock will outperform in the short term, which strike price should you buy and what expiration date?

To answer these questions, you need to find out what the risk/reward ratios are.

For instance, in a coin flip, let's say you gain $100 on heads and you lose $100 on tails. It's a 50/50 game and your expected return is $0 ($100 x 50% + -$100 X 50%).

Another coin flip game gives you $200 on heads and you lose $100 on tails. The expected return is $50 on this game ($200x50% + -$100x50%).

So you definitely want to play this game. Why? Because risk/reward is in your favor, meaning your gains are larger than your losses for the same chances of each happening.

This is what's called having a ""positive convexity"" risk/reward.

It's exactly the same concept in not just options but anything actually.

Look at the below risk/reward profile for PDD call option.

\[picture of PDD total return profile\]

images are not allowed here so if you want to check out graphs, please check out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) or YouTube channel.

This is a graph of a total return profile for PPD call option in different scenarios. This assumes that you bought the option today and held it until 11/30/2021 for about 2.5 months.

On 11/30, you would have 52 days left until expiration.

Say if a stock price goes down 30%, you lose 100% of your premium and if the stock price goes up 30%, you gain 146% on your premium.

You apply the exact same concept with the coin flip here.

Your stock goes down 30% and you lose 100%. Your stock goes up 30% but you gain 146%. This is a positive convexity risk/reward profile.

However, the major difference is that if the stock doesn't move at all, you lose 75% of your money due to theta decay, which will be covered in future memos. This is a very important point and you should follow this strategy only if you expect large price movements in the underlying stock.

Now back to the discussion. What we are trying to determine is what exercise price and expiration date we should buy.

I currently hold this call option in PDD. This one expires in 4 months with $130 strike price, and the stock closed at $104.

I have this position and my potential exit date is 2.5 months from now, on 11/30/2021.

At the expiration date, I will only have 1.5 months left. That is not an ideal situation because ideally, I want to have at least 2 months left until expiration. This is because the value of money that you lose each day due to theta decay on options gets exponentially higher within the 2 months of expiration.

Next, my holding period, as discusssed before, will be about 2.5 months from now.

Stock price is currently at $104 and the option premium is $5.3, or $530 because each option consists of 100 stocks.

When the stock price unchanged by 11/30, your total loss is 75%, meaning you lose 75% of your option premium.

This loss due to theta decay, meaning you lose the time value of the option so it's very important that you expect some type of volatility when purchasing options.

Delta is percentage change in the premium of the option per 1 % change in the underlying stock price.

Basically, the higher the delta, the higher the option premium movement per 1% movement in the stock price.

Theta is how much you lose per day on the premium due to time decay. Every day, your option premium goes down because that time value of option loses value due to shorter time to expiration.

Finally, the return on investment is what you want to pay attention to.

If the stock goes down by 30%, you will most likely lose 100% of your option premium.

If the stock goes up 30%, you can gain close to 150%, or more than double your money.

As mentioned before, you want this upside to be the highest as possible, with as low theta decay as possible.

I have capital gains on the call right now and I'm trying to determine whether to sell this or not.

I am still very confident in the stock's performance but I think there may be some turbulence in the short term so I want to decrease my risk exposure.

So 2 main goals: 1) extend time horizon and 2) reduce risk.

One way to accomplish these goals is to find which options to roll into.

Let's compare my current call option with another call option that expires in April 2022 with a higher strike price at $150.

The total return profiles look pretty close right?

I know the total return on the new position may be lower than the current one but the great benefit of buying this new call option is that my expiration date is further out.

At the end of my assumed holding period until 11/30/2021, I still have 4.5 months left until expiration.

Generally speaking, I like to have at least 4 months until expiration when I sell my options. So if I buy a 8-month call option and 4 months goes by, I decide to sell it or roll into other options.

So this new call option allows me to achieve 1) similar total returns and 2) extend my time horizon.

I'm also going to reinvest only 80% of my proceeds from the original call option to reduce risk.

I know there are a lot of moving pieces in options but the main idea I wanted to get across is assessing the risk/reward for any investment that you are making, whether it be options, stocks, MBA degree, or buying a house.

When you're buying options, buy the ones that will have the greatest convexity, meaning the biggest gains for % price change upwards compared to % price change downwards.

This can usually be done via purchasing far OTM options.

Everyone's goal should be to get more bang for their buck.

I've been watching Uber's business for quite a long time, since before their IPO. Here we've got this technology company that has designed a ""product"" that could ostensibly become ingrained into our everyday lives. I put product in quotes, because all they really did was copy the taxi industry and upload it to a google maps. But that doesn't in itself make it a bad idea, or, more importantly, a bad business, and they could come to own personal transportation in the future. They are making progress into the food delivery and freight businesses. Most people have used an Uber before, or at the very least know someone who has. Possibly some of you are Uber drivers right now.

Yet the company has never printed a profit - in fact, they have spent (lost) cash at an astounding rate. (note: Uber's incoming showing in 2Q21 was mainly due to a paper-gain in their investment of DIDI, which went public earlier this year and which Uber owns a 12% early entry stake.  
[Uber's Financials (trailng 12 months)](https://imgur.com/z3i7eEO)

Now, obviously this is no need to throw the stock out, as many of today's largest companies had similar beginnings. Growth companies invest in the future just like we do with our stocks. But the question must be asked: Does Uber have a reasonable path to sustainable profit?  


I think it's possible. Uber is investing heavily in research, marketing, and driver acquisition and retention. They could simply spend less, and they'd likely be able to provide positive cash flow immediately. But I don't think this is Uber's vision. Uber likely needs to become one of the main modes of transportation for a lot of people. Not just taking an Uber to the bar or to the airport. People need to see ""Ubering"" as one of their main transportation options. ""Should we take the subway? I'll call a cab? No let's just get an Uber."" This conversation needs to become the norm. So they are currently between a rock and a hard place, investing back their revenue to make Uber rides cheaper and more convenient. 

  
What are main the things holding this company back? Aside from their research and development and marketing expenditures, which I see as mostly necessary, the foremost problem i see is definitely the **DRIVER**. Uber has to pay drivers. They have to background check them. They have to deal with accidents. They have to refund you if your Eats driver eats your double cheeseburger. They have to deal with the ramifications a global pandemic, preventing people from wanting to get in a vehicle with another person. 

Uber at one point was doing research into self-driving cars. [They've since sold off that part of their business](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55224462). What do we think about this decision? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is Uber just early? It's certainly possible that Uber will be remembered as one of the ""too early"" tech companies. Companies that had the right idea, but not the societal infrastructure around it to succeed.  Companies destined to be replaced by a slew of more evolved, more efficient offspring. Picture with me a future: Densely-packed urban areas. 50, 60, 100 million people (look at China, not too far away). No personal vehicles allowed throughout most of the city, and certainly no combustion engines. The standard mode of transportation are personal single or double occupancy ""pods"" that you call from your mobile device. [How about something like this, from the video game Detroit Become Human](https://imgur.com/f9vu4aQ). Picks you up, drops you off. No driver, no hassle (no sexual assault lawsuits either). It works because the whole city's network facilitates it. In this vision, I see Uber (and similar companies) being one of the most important companies in the entire world. But again, maybe they're too early.

Last week I touched on a topic that was very helpful to everyone and gained much traction. This week I want to discuss just 1 major huge blunder.. No matter how great we are we all have made at least 1 mistake this past year.

So please share with us 1 or more mistakes you have made so that others do not, or hopefully not make the same mistake. As a start I will tell you all my main mistake, how I fell into that mistake/why and where I should and will likely cut my losses in the future.

I actually have 2 major mistakes this past year but they are in the same field. The mortgage sector. I was actually trading 5 names, but got stock in 2. I was trading LDI, HMPT, RKT, UWMC and COOP. The reason being that the mortgage sector was hugely profitable. They make cash hands over fists. They can do buybacks, special dividends and they do!

So what happened? The 4th quarter of 2020 was absolutely smashing for the whole sector. All 5 at that time were making new highs. RKT and UWMC got the Reddit retail status. RKT, UWMC were actually doing buybacks and special dividends. LDI, which I am down a lot on actually smashed earnings badly, announced a special dividend first, a regular dividendâ¦.so how would you know not to buy? HMPT reported, the report was amazing. This was actually 10.50 after hoursâ¦. Then RKT reported \[The market leader\] the entire sector was a sinking ship. LDI and HMPT never recovered UWMC and RKT with their social media fame did for some time, but those 2 were stuck.

What should I have done? Next time a market leader misses a report, and warns of margins I will sell at least half my position..if not more. It is usually the case that if the market leader shows weakness it may spreadâ¦what happened on the 2nd quarter report ending 6/30â¦ HMPT and LDI laid eggs, which were foreshadowed in RKTâs report.

What was I waiting for? COOP reported earnings first before the whole sectorâ¦ COOP beat by 3 dollarsâ¦. COOP is not the industry leader. I had it in my head to take the loss on LDI at 12, HMPT at 6â¦.. I did not pull the trigger, after they released reports it went straight downâ¦â¦

So what I learned is sell at least half!! Unless you do not mind waiting. They will be fine and are not going anywhere but I would rather not wait 3-6-9 months. 

Please share blunders so we can all try and get some ideas of what to do if we are in a similar situation.

Number 1 thing I ask myself before every trade. Am I willing to baghold this? If not, then I must think of my stop loss **BEFORE** I ever even buy any shares to begin with. Make peace with a potential loss before the trade even begins. If you can't make peace with the potential loss, then it's not a good risk/reward ratio. Wait for the right play to come along.

You know what I'm talking about. When you buy a stock, with no stop loss in mind, no acceptance of a potential loss, and you tell yourself that you'll just wing it. You'll sell if you feel like you really have to sell. But the thing is, if you really asked yourself... ""am I ready to potentially commit to a long-term bagholding session with this company?.... You might think twice about a ""winging it"" strategy.

You could potentially have that dead money locked up for two years (or more) while you wait for it's value to bounce back (assuming it even does!)

Reuters: Russian stocks to climb higher throughout 2022](https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-stocks-poll-idUSL8N2PR3I8)

&gt; Russian stocks have been on the rise after collapsing in the first quarter of 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak became global, gaining support from a recovery in oil prices, an easing risk of sanctions and an influx of retail investors.

In addition to oil prices, a growing market of retail investors in Russia seems to be significant. We've all seen how much retail investors can affect the market these days.

Not to mention, the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline finished the other day, but flows haven't started.

&gt; âThe environment is quite conducive right now,â Viktor Szabo, an  investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. âGrowth  has been stable and tensions with the U.S. appear to have eased.â
&gt;
&gt; Geopolitics is another key factor contributing to the Russian IPO  renaissance. Though relations between the U.S. and Russia remain near  their lowest since the Cold War, the summit in June between President  Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin           alleviated some market concerns about tough new sanctions, investors say.

Although geopolitical concerns should never be nonexistent with Russia, it seems they are at their lowest in years. If you pay attention to geopolitics news, you may have also noticed a rising popularity in geopolitical papers for the idea that the US should court Russia in order to counter China.

Financial Times has also run articles about Russia's [""market boom"" and IPO spree](https://www.ft.com/content/e71b6d7e-1c7c-434f-adab-4225715e88dd)  as well as [the bullish sentiment on Russia's massive agriculture industry:](https://www.ft.com/content/4d925bae-fa89-4e64-9063-0c01e3b5690c)

&gt;Investors have also noticed, attracted by the longer-term potential. Jim Rogers, who co-founded Quantum Fund with George Soros and is now a renowned bull on Russia and China, has invested in Russian fertilisers and agriculture via Phosagro and believes the sectorâs success is only starting. 

Also relevant is news that Russia's Sberbank is undertaking a [push to become Russia's Amazon.](https://www.ft.com/content/b7bc4579-e232-41e2-b14b-e45361b6a814)

iShares Russia ETF **$ERUS** is up 24% YTD while VanEck Russia ETF **$RSX** is up 23.44%. They have dividend yields of 4.12% and 2.72%, respectively.

Instead, he suggests looking for great companies and then go all in if the price is fair. Great companies you can hold for many many years. I think this is an amazing advice that I adopted. 

I've noticed that there's a lot of psychology behind evaluating if a stock is at a fair price.  When I want to buy a new stock, I would be very critical of the price. I will look at all the metrics and compare it to other companies in its industry, etc. However, after I buy a stock, I'd be much less critical. For example, let's say Shopify today traded at ATH around $1800. I'd probably not buy the stock. However, if I bought it a year ago for $900 I'd probably keep holding it at $1800 cause I believe it's a great company that will keep growing. 

Ignoring tax implications of holding vs selling (short vs long term gain), we can say that every time we decide to hold a stock we make a decision to buy it. Why do we more likely to hold than buy? I think that's because the psychology of making and losing money. If I buy Shopify at $1800 and tomorrow it goes down to $1600, I lose actual money. No one likes to lose money. If I bought it at $900 and it went to $1800 and then $1600, I'm still happy with my return.

I think another reason for holding is that it's easier. If you sell you need to find something else to invest in that you think will give you better returns. Once we found a company that has given us nice returns we're happy with, it's just easier to keep betting on it, even though it doesn't always work (winners keep winning until they don't). 

How wonder how you deal with the hold or sell decision? Do you often take short term profits and exit a position? Do you alway set stop losses to ensure your profit doesn't go below a certain price? etc.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3035476,public,self,"Warren Buffett and the psychology behind buying, holding, and selling",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pm6i33/warren_buffett_and_the_psychology_behind_buying/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

* Affirm is a major player in the booming âpoint of sale financingâ or âbuy now pay laterâ niche.
* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.
* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.
* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.

**What they do:**

Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  
 

Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyerâs credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  
 

Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  
 

There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  
 

Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  
 

Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  
 

Affirmâs relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.

**Why theyâre spiking in interest:**  
 

Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  
 

The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  
 

That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  
 

The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  
 

There has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  
 

Shopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  
 

Notable comments from Reddit:  
 

""Iâm long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If youâve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, itâs a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or âGreen Skyâ to open up to home and auto loans.""

\- PinBot1138  
 

âPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.â  
 \- Lukebreit  
 

Signal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.

 

**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**

The buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

McKinsey &amp; Companyâs annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: heâs one of the founders of PayPal.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirmâs Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Six of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it âBuyâ, with the other 4 placing it at âHoldâ. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.

&amp;#x200B;

Rapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.

&amp;#x200B;

Post-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.

&amp;#x200B;

**What the risks are:**

Affirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  
 

Affirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sectorâs rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  
 

Affirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Companyâs results.  
 

Affirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Companyâs gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  
 

The buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  
 

***Bottom line:***Â *Affirmâs lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth.

Speaking to CNBC, McMullen also predicted 2%-3% inflation for the rest of the year for the company's inputs. He added that the chain can pass most of the costs associated with increased commodities prices to its customers.

Kroger shares dropped more than 7% on Friday even though the company reported earnings and revenue that nominally topped expectations.

The company's margins decreased by 60 basis points, and many investors apparently saw that as their cue to take profits on the stock after KR ran up 24% in the two months heading into the earnings report.

McMullen told CNBC that half of the margin decline came as a result of disruptions in Kroger's supply chain, which drove up costs. The other half came from a rise in stolen products fueled by an increased prevalence of organized crime.

McMullen said shoplifting by organized crime has become more prevalent in the past year or two. He added that he has been working with other retailers and law-enforcement authorities to counter the problem.

The CEO suggested that technology might make it easier for criminals to sell their ill-gotten products, making ""shrinkage"" â  the industry term for merchandise lost to theft â  a bigger problem.

""In the past, it would have been more flea markets, much harder to sell,"" he said. ""[But] if you look at the current market, it's much easier to sell in the market.""

KR dropped $3.48 on Friday to close at $42.67. Shares had advanced from early July into last week, when the stock set a closing 52-week high of $47.31. KR also established an intraday 52-week peak of $47.99

If you are like me, many of us came to Reddit the same time in January. I wanted to see what it was about and how a chat could make a stock go up so much. To be honest in the last 7-8 months I have added more tickers to watch lists, created watch lists because what I do is add a ticker if it is mentioned a lot. 

Yesterday was the first time I bought something that I never heard of until Reddit. I will not mention the ticker because it is a 1 dollar stock and I do not want to get banned. I would just like to get some honest ideas on practices of other redditors, if they do some DD, add to a watch list or just go in a buy!

What I normally do, if I see the ticker mentioned at least 3x  I add it to a watch list I call âRiskyâ, I believe I have over 150 tickers now here, I finally traded 1 yesterday. In the mornings though around 7-8AM. I will look at this watch list and see if there is heavy volume, gainers and add it to my list of stocks I am ready to trade. This can also be because I have been trading since 1994 and I am fairly disciplined.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserveâs important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fedâs plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fedâs first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
&gt; # Hot CPI
&gt; âIf the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,â Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after Augustâs producer price index â which was released Friday â showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
&gt; The Fedâs formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after Augustâs employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; âCertainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, itâs an issue for the bond market if itâs viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,â CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; âIf markets have an inflation mutiny here and thereâs volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,â Donabedian said of the Fedâs taper announcement. âBut I think thereâs kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.â
*****
&gt; # Stagflation?
&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after Augustâs weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
&gt; âIâm more about the âflationâ side of it than the âstag.â I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,â Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a âshort-term warning.â
*****
&gt; âWe had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. Itâs really settled down now,â he said. âThere was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and youâre going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why youâre seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.â
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
&gt; âWith where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,â he said. âEven though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. Thereâs income there for consumers to spend. Weâre looking at this as a short-term hiccup.â
*****
&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; âIt has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We donât have that,â he said. âThese are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isnât the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldnât call it stagflation.â
*****
https://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png
*****
&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fedâs September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
&gt; âWeâre up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,â Donabedian said. âThese are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is itâs going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.â
*****
&gt; # Now watch Congress
&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
&gt; âTheyâre going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,â he said. âItâs the overall corporate tax rate, itâs the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.â
*****
&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. âThose sort of issues went quiet over the summer but itâs back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.â
*****
&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock marketâs gains. âOne very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. Thatâs a direct hair cut,â he said.

&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.

&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by monthâs end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18

&gt; Septemberâs option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during Septemberâs option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

&gt; In todayâs blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

&gt; The catch (and thereâs always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasnât pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. âLooking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,â explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âSo should we see any seasonal weakness, weâd use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.â

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

Stocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.

First off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said âThe Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and todayâs call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while Chinaâs demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.â This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.

In other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, âAnyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this wonât be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind weâre still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.â

Now, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Appleâs 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

**Highlights**

* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. Itâs probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).
* The crackdown in China continuesâ¦ This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were âurged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflareâs was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.
* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, donât see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FBâs absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)
* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.
* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to âgo super hardcoreâ to make up for production challenges to âensure a decent Q3 delivery number.â The CEO also said, âThis is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.â I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Accenture (ACN) with two target raises. Stock currently around $341
   * Morgan Stanley from $330 to $380 at Overweight
   * Bank of America from $324 to $379 at Buy
* Shares of Affirm (AFRM) gapped up 34% after the company absolutely demolished earnings and raises guidance. Also received a host of target upgrades, with average price target being $140 at Buy.
* Caesars Entertainment (CZR) target raised by Cowen from $120 to $125 at Outperform. Stock currently around $104
* Danaher (DHR) target raised by Bank of America from $340 to $360 at Buy. Stock currently around $330

For instance, it ended down $3.06 today but the latest after hours figure shows +$19.24.  It also doesnt seem to update regularly after hours.  I have seen it fluctuate like this a lot pre and post trading hours so I'm curious if anyone knows why it's like this.

As housing becomes more expensive, with Covid spending and interest rates, I could see an even larger push for more density to combat housing prices.  Many companies are already fleeing to places like Texas to avoid California's high real estate prices.  Homeless are already a large issue, rents are still going up above wages, companies like Blackrock are buying up real estate due to 30 year treasuries paying 2%.

One of the biggest issue with increasing density in these large cities will be utilities, such as water and electricity.  This is where I think something like California Water Service group could be a great stock to hold, as much of the existing infrastructure will have to be redone to allow dense housing to be build.

In recent decades, cash-rich companies have used buybacks to reward stockholders and share-incented employees. Apple (ticker: APPL) spent over $400 billion on buybacks in the last 10 years, while Microsoft (MSFT) spent nearly $130 billion. Since 2017, annual spending on buybacks by companies in the S&amp;P 500 index totaled $650 billion each year, on average, according to an Aug. 6 report by J.P. Morgan quant analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. Some 20% to 30% of those buybacks were funded with debtâthe rest with corporate cash.

Brown and Wyden said the 2% excise tax would make corporations think twice about allocating capital to buybacks, instead of hiring or capital investment. Spending by the S&amp;P 500 companies on buybacks rose 11% from this yearâs March to June quarters, said J.P. Morganâs Lakos-Bujas. Capital expenditures rose 6%. Spending on dividends slipped 3%.

Rogers said that Apple was not a monopolist and âsuccess is not illegal.â",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3033771,public,self,"Apple can no longer force developers to use in-app purchasing, judge rules in Epic Games case",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/plo5zx/apple_can_no_longer_force_developers_to_use_inapp/,all_ads,6,tickernews,5a4c814a-65e6-11e5-b65e-122ab0778f8b,Company News,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'LBm3Kjj1kUxuDRbdLuVYOJbb2jJVFe2jpLmyP3PWl_o', 'resolutions': [{'height': 71, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89fa199b71e3512fc73002f473b78d1241e9c70b', 'width': 108}, {'height': 143, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8acd517363680102178442747aa12929a7e0668b', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=288ef21ffdf59317f6a34c022023cc4c74577277', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5649ce53c3b23775a994f02422534a6b0f24c17', 'width': 640}, {'height': 639, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38302401ab58311df0fcd62a5c7522b8b020922', 'width': 960}, {'height': 719, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9f12095773cc596cb08138d23338e5754174159', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1825, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/cxzNjKmM0QFFpXcvDIhHieLi_lkEL440Iuch-_aWBqE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=19924a08b4641c756f272dab3a95cce222fbfabe', 'width': 2738}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

I often create LMT bracket orders to buy when the price gets to my predetermined level.

Sometimes I notice:

* the second I transmit my order the price jumps immediately.
* If a stock price is going down and I lower my bracket Sell order closer to the current price it causes the price to drop drastically in that exact second.

I believe the Algos are seeing when a new buyer or seller enters in a new order and act in a way that makes you chase the stock for entry or exit.

**How can I overcome this issue?**

I see a lot of traders who trade like me (most notably ross from YT) don't use bracket orders at all and they just use the hotkeys to enter and exit and watch the tape for the price they looking for before hitting the hotkey.

Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) set their expectations for the full year 2021, which seem to be following the trajectory they have set in February. The company expects subscription revenue growth to be driven by more merchants joining at a rate below that in 2020. Shopify also expects a leveling off in growth rates from the record 2020, based on the activity in GMV. The growth will also be driven by further utilization of Shopify's expanded menu of offerings, such as: Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping, and Shopify Capital.

In this article, after looking at the fundamental performance thus far, we will take a dive into what insiders have been doing with Shopify stock.

Shopify had a great year, is currently a US$187b Market Cap company, and the number two ecommerce retailer in the US behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A better picture of Shopify's growth story and analysts expectations can be seen in the chart below:

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open higher this morning after we saw a somewhat choppy session yesterday. After the 4th day of consecutive losses in the market, we are seeing strength in premarket trading today. We'll see if that strength lasts, or if we continue to see some selling off. We should be getting some inflation data in, and this could be an important factor in determining if the Fed steps in yet or not. We could see some more choppiness today, just make sure you stay disciplined in your trading.

SPY is trading a bit under 451. I'll be watching action around the SMA(9), which is around 451.50. If we cannot get back up to that level, we could see some more selling off back towards 448, or further. DIA is trading a bit under 351. It's back up above the SMA(200) after dropping below it during yesterday's trading, but I'll be watching price action around that 350 support level. QQQÂ isÂ trading right around 381, and I'll be watching the 380 support level. If it holds up, it could see more strength. Gold and silver are trading slightly in the red this morning, while crude oil is up. Crude oil looks to test that resistance level of $70 per barrel. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 46,400 and could see some more weakness today. I'll be watching to see if we break down below 45,000 or hold up. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are trading slightly higher in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocksÂ saw some strength yesterday, and look to break out of their consolidation in the near future. We will likely test resistance levels in today's trading, and will be worth following into next week. I still have doubts surrounding recovery plays given the state of things, but the charts are looking decent from a technical analysis standpoint. Meme stocks will be worth keeping an eye on. GME was down over 10% during intraday trading yesterday, but managed to finish green on the day. AMC is currently looking like it could break out on the daily chart, I'll be watching.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

Yet there were signs some investors could be steering a bit more money out of stocks, as Bank of Americaâs Flow Show reported that $15.2 billion was allocated to cash in the latest week, the biggest influx in five weeks. The week saw $12.7 billion allocated to equities, $12.6 billion to bonds, but $200 million out of gold ï¿¼, which is traditionally viewed as a haven for investors worried about an economic slowdown.

The S&amp;P 500 ï¿¼ has gained nearly 20% so far this year, which is ahead of a 16% return in 2020, though below a 28% return in 2019. On a continous basis, gold has dropped 5% this year, versus a 24% rise in 2020.

Personally, I have invested in the penny stock, Velocys PLC. Theyâre a British company who have planning permission to develop a plant in the UK. I believe they will use woody biomass for aviation fuel and have partnered with British Airways. They also have projects in the US and Japan.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I think there is still a lot of potential. Here is my write up with sources. 

Background:  KAVL is a public US company. They distribute Bibi Sticks and Bidi Pouches (Product line about to launch soon). The reason the company is structured like this is because Bidi is a foreign manufacturer of vape / tobacco products. It is against US regulations for a foreign manufacturer of these type of products to distribute directly in the US. So KAVL being public in the US is allowed to distribute in the US.  


1. Kaival Brands Innovations Group Inc. is poised To Benefit From Ongoing Shift Away From Combustible Tobacco Products:   
\- To summarize, KAVL has been extremely diligent, making sure their product passes FDA regulation. Many of their competitors fail to do this. It is my assumption that the FDA grants grace periods for new vape products entering the market. Many companies pump during their grace period, then dissolve and restructure. You have seen this with Puff &gt;Fume and other similar companies. KAVL has built their company around making sure they meet FDA regulations so they can build their product and brand.

4. They took a hit after the last Quarterly Reporting.   
 ""Kaival Brands recognizes revenue in two ways, which is similar to other consumer product brands. Typically, the Company will receive an order from a retailer or distributor and subsequently ship from its fulfilment center. Under typical payment terms, Kaival Brands receives payment for the product at the time the customer obtains control of the products. In addition, the Company has some contracts with 120-day payment terms, which is common practice when working with larger wholesalers and distributors. With respect to these types of orders, Kaival Brands fulfills and ships the entire product order upfront to the distributor, and then receives payment for products upon sale of the product by the wholesale or distributor, as applicable, payable on a recurring monthly basis. This payment cycle lasts 120-days. Our most recent orders with 120-day terms, represents an aggregate of approximatelyÂ $41.6 million, were placed inÂ April 2021Â by GSW and C-Store Master. Despite these orders being placed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue recognition rules require us to recognize revenues once the product sells, or payment is received, of which there can be no assurance.""

Anyways, two that spring to mind for me are **AMD** and **QCOM**. AMD's ATH is $122.49. It closed today at $106.15. It's a bit over 13 percent below it's ATH. QCOM's ATH is $167.94. It closed today at $141.58  It's about 15.7 percent below it's ATH.

So, if you imagine that AMD or Qualcomm will hit a new ATH in the next six months, it might be worth it to jump in there for a quick 13 or 16 percent, respectively.

**Why I sold:**

* Stock is +20% above my price target of $170 (*40x multiple on my FY '21 EBITDA forecast*) after their recent earnings call without showing growth in buyers sequentially quarter/quarter. To get to today's price, I'll have to bump that multiple to 50x.

&amp;#x200B;

* My original thesis was  ETSY will be a multi-year ***high*** growth story due to secular growth from online shopping + taking more market share as they continue to improve the site + scarcity value of the products they sell (*handcrafted goods you won't find anywhere else even after the economy opens*). But, that thesis has broken in a few months:
   * ***Secular growth from online shopping***: Online shopping will continue to grow, but it has definitely shown maturity since ETSY has pulled forward multiple years of buyers growth. In the five years before the pandemic, ETSY increased active buyers by \~19%. Assuming buyers doesn't change from the recent quarter, ends at 90m for 2021, and applying those same growth rates for 2022 going forward... ETSY would be adding 20m - 30m buyers a year and eventually get to 180m buyers by 2025. I don't see that happening and supports my thesis on maturity and probably a lower multiple as well.
   * ***Market share***: I agree they will continue taking more market share in online shopping. It's a good platform and they are making great improvements
   * ***Scarcity value***: I overestimated the ""scarcity value of handcrafted goods that you can't find anywhere else"" as ETSY mentioned recent &amp; upcoming results could be adversely affected anyways as consumers spend their money in stores, services, travel, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Delta is an upside risk for the stock, but I haven't seen sufficient evidence that this will deliver meaningful upside for ETSY. A substantial portion of Americans are vaccinated and are going out as usual &amp; the credit card/sales data I've seen hasn't shown a meaningful uptick for online spending.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm not sure how meaningful this will be, but Amazon Prime Day was Q3 '20 and there is no Prime Day to comp against in Q3 '21 so the comps for the quarter they'll report on could be tough for any retailer with an online presence that benefit from the day

&amp;#x200B;

**Key takeaway**: Company has pulled multiple years of growth already so it's closer to maturity, I don't believe Delta will provide a meaningful tailwind for upcoming results, and it's trading at a 50x multiple when I expect lower growth going forward.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3032111,public,self,Why I decided to sell ETSY,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pl8fjh/why_i_decided_to_sell_etsy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

ZIM here the train is already gone with a 400% YTD performance. However they have a strong balance sheet and based in Israele is a big plus as to shipping containers is a very great location. Mkcap of 6B atm.

Stocks opened higher in the morning before turning lower as market participants continue to balance a hot jobs market against a dent in economic momentum caused by surging coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US. The three major indexes are having one of the worst-performing streaks this year, while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fared slightly better.

According to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and the 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans.Â 

Coinciding with an increase in job openings, in its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, âThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.âÂ 

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the âsubstantial further progress markâ the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, âI think that one more good job report if itâs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.â August was not the report they were looking for.Â 

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant.Â 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

**Highlights**

* The crackdown in China continuesâ¦ This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were âurged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflareâs was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.
* Weekly first-time unemployment claims came in at 310,000, a pandemic-era low, well below estimates of 335,000
* JP Morgan (JPM) announced it was acquiring Infatuation, a company that owns different websites and apps that guide diners to restaurants in cities around the world from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Could be to make a new dining credit card reward program or something
* Ray-Ban and Facebook (FB) have teamed up to release new smart glasses that have a camera, mic and speakers, and a voice assistant to let you do things hands-free, similar to Snapchatâs (SNAP) glasses. Honestly, I donât know what these would be useful for right now
* With the NFL kicking off today, sports betting analysis firm PlayUSA says it expects over $20 billion to be wagered, nearly tripling the $7.5 billion wagered in 2020. Iâm a huge sports fan and sports betting stock bull. My fav currently is PENN

The business news channel has signed a new deal with Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money and Squawk on the Street regular.

One key new aspect: The deal also includes a multiplatform element, with Cramer set to write articles and create web videos for CNBCâs website. The company will also launch a new subscription product, the CNBC Investor Club with Jim Cramer, and will work with Cramer to create and launch new live events and conferences.

Cramer had previously founded TheStreet.com, which he sold to TheMaven in 2019. TheStreet had been the exclusive home for Cramerâs digital commentary and subscription stock tips. Now, Cramer will bring those products to CNBC through Cramer Digital. Margaret de Luna, who was previously president and COO of TheStreet, recently joined CNBC as GM and senior vp of its direct-to-consumer businesses.

The company is betting that Cramerâs infectious personality and established digital and TV bona fides will help it turbocharge its direct-to-consumer offerings.

âJim Cramer is truly one of a kind. He has the unique ability to masterfully break down complex topics and make them digestible for everyday investors,â said CNBC chairman Mark Hoffman in a statement. âAnd now, for the first time, CNBC will be the home for all of Jimâs media creating a virtuous cycle for his devoted viewers and loyal members to easily engage with exclusive content across all platforms and serve as a one-stop shop for sponsors and advertisers looking to interact with Jimâs comprehensive suite of products on a deeper level.â

Rocket Labs debuted on the market a few weeks ago as the result of a [redacted] merger (which is why the price history goes back to last October) and after a short post-partum dip has put paid to its name, rocketing 96% in the past 6 days.

They reported in June that order backlog had increased over 130% yoy.

Only 2% of the stock is in institutional hands (not entirely confident of this number given an institution had to front the [redacted]).

The market cap sits at $6.8 billion, and the company expects $4-5M revenue in Q3. That sets P/S near 350, but the revenue curve should steepen as they deliver and prove they can deliver.

They 3D-print almost the entire rocket, and can easily expand production just by duplicating capacity. If I knew who was making their printers I'd invest in them, too. This production method gives them an edge in precision and weight, as well as turnaround on changes. I can see every other rocket builder drooling over their manufacturing system.

As yet, they are making fairly small rockets, but have a much larger one in development.

1.) I am not a financial, accounting, tax, or legal advisor.

2.) This Due Diligence is made solely for fun/private usage and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events.

I think Liquidity Services has a lot of potential and just entered a dip. 

Some background:

Liquidity Services operates a network of e-commerce marketplaces. Its online auction marketplaces include: Liquidation.com, GovDeals.com, Network International, GoIndustry DoveBid, IronDirect, Machinio, and Secondipity.com. According to its website, LQDT operates the worldâs largest B2B e-commerce marketplace platform for surplus assets with over $8.5 Billion of completed transactions, more than 3.8 million registered buyers and 15,000 corporate and government sellers. The closest competitors that I could find are all government-owned online auction marketplaces for government surplus.

This might be a little long so please bear with me.

I am just learning how to do options. In late August I bought 3 put options (bought 3 @ 1.50) for DKS after I saw the price climb when they announced a $5.50 special dividend on September 9th. I just got an email from Vanguard yesterday that reads: ""Your open order for DKS Option will be canceled on 9/8/2021 due to a corporate action. A corporate action is a change to a company or its underlying stock that may affect its stockholders. Examples include (but are not limited to) splits, dividends, delisting, mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs.""

Ok so I assume the order is cancelled as described above. When I check the option in my account, it is still there, and is giving me the option to Sell to Close, with following underneath ""Each contract represents 100 shares of DKS and $550.00"". I understand how the $550 came about (special dividend of $5.50 x 100 shares), but I am confused how to price this to close the option.

We decided to invest $10 a week for both kids, but let them pick the stocks. The goal to teach them about investing. It will also be interesting to see what they pick over time and how they do. It's only \~$1k per year, educational, fun, and saving for their future. Accounts are still in our names, cash accounts only, no options, so risk is minimal and the investments are small enough that we're ok if they lose it haha.

One child is 7, so far he picked Moderna because of the high returns it's had this year.

The other is 1.5, so she rolls a few dice to pick the page and # on the list for that stock. Somehow she ALSO picked Moderna lol.

We'll see how it plays out in the long term, but it gives us something fun to do together and teach them about investing. We'll stay away from options for the time being haha.

Now I have around 250 dollars which are just lying around and I won't be needing them anytime soon so I want to invest that too. 

Not gonna buy more stocks because for that you need to study about it a lot and I don't have time for that due to academic burden. I want to put my money in mutual funds but **the question is should I put money in new mutual funds or should I just invest the money in my previous 3 mutual funds?** Please tell the pros and cons of both options and feel free to give any other advice you can too, I am here to learn.

Sorry. Itâs just an idea. Iâm not sure if it would work but Iâm definitely thinking about trying it âsomehowâ with my broker-dealer software because I feel it could inevitably work. 

Thinking back to the financial crisis, would currency swaps have slowed the recession? Not the default swaps, but the currency swaps. Iâll give an example and my calculations:

Assume our contract initiates at 12pm EST and is valid for one week. Imagine weâre someone whoâs a portfolio manager. Because of the financial crisis, we canât sell our toxic assets.

Say we had 1000 shares of some stock âAâ valued at 14.65 USD October 9th, 2008. Say October 9th, we enter a currency swap agreement with an overseas broker in Australia because we notice a crisis agreeing to swap cash flow on the securities but not the securities themselves. 

I swap my 14650 USD, the value of my now pegged 1000 shares, in for say maybe some stake in Australiaâs big bank stock âBâ valued at 36.96 AUD. The USD/AUD rate is 1.4237.  So at the initiation of the contract, I receive 20857 AUD (for the 564 shares of âBâ) and the Australia broker receives my 14650 USD. To clarify, I never swapped the stocks, just the cash flow or currency. The contract is valid for 1 week. Due to the swap, neither I nor the overseas dealer can touch either security or access the cash flow for that week and put them in an escrow account (letâs just use a week as an example). 

The contract expires November 10th at 12 pm. When it does, our cash flows are returned. 

1. I receive my 1000 shares valued at 12.32 now meaning my equity is 12320 USD. I also receive my dollars back but I receive my USD back at the USDAUD rate that day at 1.4526. My Aussie counterpart received 21280.59 AUD back and his 564 shares of B valued at 39.50 (22,278). Because the dollar fell, i must pay out I must pay out the difference between so I pay Aussie 291 USD. 

I receive 14358 USD so total profitâdifference between equity and cash along with the money we need to pay the Aussie (1797 USD). Aussie profits 978 USD at the contracts end.  

But imagine we didnât do this!! Weâd be 2330 USD in the hole if we hadnât swapped. And our Aussie at the end of the day collects the same profit but our loss is offset by 533 USD! Thatâs a 23% decrease just by utilizing the exchange rate and weâd still be paying a fee. 

Im honestly tired, I hope this makes sense and I donât sound like a compete dumbass. Could someone with a series 34 license possibly give any insight? If technically thereâs a guarantee the dollar would fall and that AUD would rise temporarily, then we could be able to offset some of the losses by JUST the exchange rate alone.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3030638,public,self,What are your thoughts on this idea?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pkw3c9/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_idea/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,

What if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?

Amazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing. Spending on  cloud/SaaS is expected to grow by 18.4% in 2021 alone.

**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** 

To begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, letâs use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companyâs average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So letâs break it down

EV stands for âEnterprise Valueâ. Enterprise value is made up of the companyâs equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companyâs value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companyâs shares.

So we have nvidiaâs equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) 

Now that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a businessâs profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we arenât going there. 

Formula: So weâll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then weâll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 

EBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) 

So we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 

What do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. Youâre looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. 

**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**

Before Nvidiaâs stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. 

Tesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isnât hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Teslaâs 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldnât be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. 

Besides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. 

**#2: Technical Analysis** 

Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isnât as black and white, but thatâs the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

Daily Chart: 

Sorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow.

I can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.

Option A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high

Or Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.

But Nvidia isnât a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. 

**How Iâm playing Nvidia**

Yes, Iâm in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and Iâm sure I missed more important things, but this is where Iâm starting.

I have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. 

Price Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows.

My main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.

I am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. 

I back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.

*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*

Stocks fell today, extending the previous dayâs decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.

Yung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, âWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really whatâs going to support the market for the rest of the year.â 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly â of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous monthâs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, âWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what weâve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.â

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the âsubstantial further progress markâ the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, âI think that one more good job report if itâs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.â August was not the report they were looking for. 

In its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, âThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.â 

In the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

In other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, âWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellationâ and suggested âas it falls behind competitors \[Amazon\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behindâ (ouch).

In response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.â SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. 

**Highlights**

* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 â hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.
* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the countryâs wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I donât know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador
* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaureâs (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. 
* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range.

I am wondering this in light of information seen in tweets on the company.

I've been following several stock trading services on Twitter, and I was considering purchasing the monthly subscription for one of them. Looking further into it, I couldn't find much about the company (HFTAlert) on Google. It looks phenomenal, but I wanted to be sure beforehand since the price is hefty (~$500/mo).

Looking into other people's tweets to the service, these tweets are claiming the service is simply a rework of the McClellan Oscillator. Now, I want to get the service just to test it out and see if it's actually useful. The track record of the recommended trades seems good, but I don't know what to make of the whole situation.

1) I have listed the information from tweets supposedly explaining the situation below. I have a few questions:
2) Is it possible that this trading system is still a useful purchase and can be useful during trades?

3) Is the entire system solely just the McClellan Oscillator? Is there nothing novel about it versus what can be gained by simply using certain settings on a default McClellan Oscillator?

Has anyone tried this service? I would think that something charging such a high price has to deliver a quality service, in my opinion this can't all be so simplistic, there has to be something insightful gained by using this service. I really don't know what to think but I will try these settings described in the below tweets to test it when I have time. Can someone provide some insight after looking into the details of this service??? Thanks in advance.



Below are summaries of some of the tweets (basically I just typed in HFTAlert McClellan)

Comparison to freely available software:

""This is basically the same thing as the product: tos.mx/ntrqBH ""

The Accumulator

On Balance Volume for any stock or etf. Its simply tracking volume on bids and offers.

Solely from spending 5 minutes on their website the description of the Accumulator is just a plot of the cumulative delta (the pink Accumulator line) and a second line, the cyan one, is a moving average of it. There also seems to be the option to set it to show order book imbalances if the book is heavily stacked one way or another.

The Delineator:

""the delininator value is the Summation Index. Nothing he sells is proprietary. His ""tape reader,"" is just volume measurements in a moving average.""

""the Delineator is a breadth based system that uses the McClellan oscillator. Just put it on a 30 min chart. his delineator is the mclellan oscilator smmation index, his ""primary is the MC oscilator on a 30 minute basis, his ""secondary"" is the MC oscilator on a daily basis""

""The Delineator is a derivation of the McClellan Oscillator. It uses market breadth, not price, to measure and forecast future price direction. But more than a simplistic buy/sell indicator, the Delineator is a process of analysis and decision making that is measurable and repeatable. I designed the Delineator in 1998 when I was a portfolio manager and used it to manage our client's growth portfolios. Maintaining a disciplined approach to the timing of investment decisions is critical to long term success. This is the key benefit of using the Delineator.""

McClellan Oscillator:

""HFTALERT simply follows the mcclellan oscillator. When the mcclellan oscillator has a value of +75 or more, he tells you to go long. When it has value of -75 or more, he tells you to go short!""

Cycle Momentum:

""his ""cycle momentum"" is simply the difference in the value from the current 30 minute mclellan oscilator bar to the prior 30 minute mclellan oscilator bar.""

Cappers/ Chevrons:

""Capper stocks are a term used to describe the @McClellanOsc Summation Index""

""His chevrons are just pivots. His slope changes are just moving average cross overs 19/39 ema.

Not many people know this. So weâve just learned that Joe Rogan got the covid and recovered from it within a couple of days. He said that he took ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, and vitamin C/D. We also learned that, as Joe Rogan said it, doctors in Japan are now recommending ivermectin for all covid patients. So, what does it mean?

It may mean that we may not need any vaccines for covid at all. If the public knows this (and they will soon for sure), $MRNA and $PFE will drop like a rock.

Okay, you may say $PFE manufactures ivermectin. But Iâll tell you that ivermectin is so cheap and accessible all around the world. There are so many other manufacturers that manufacture ivermectin.

Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4

The company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. 

Here are some of their key selling points. 

Their business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back

They have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. 

The valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. 

I want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy.

Etsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. 

Mostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY.

&gt;  
&gt;**Boston Fed spokeswoman Lucy Warsh confirmed that Rosengrenâs trades were not conducted via a blind trust but âhis investment decisions are consistent with the systemâs strong ethics rules and time frames.â**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Separate filings for Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, showed multiple $1 million-plus transactions last year as the U.S economy was convulsed by Covid-19.** He also disclosed a $1 million-plus stake in the Kansas City Royals baseball team.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. central bank slashed interest rates to zero in March as the pandemic spread and began buying hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to calm financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Rosengren, who has discussed his concerns in commercial real estate in public speeches, has also advocated for the Fed to consider scaling back its MBS purchases faster than Treasuries to avoid overheating the housing market.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Wall Street Journal first reported Kaplanâs trading activity, which included transactions of over $1 million in more than a dozen companies including Delta Airlines Inc., Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Verizon Communications Inc.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**âAll transactions were reviewed by the Dallas Fedâs general counsel, who confirmed the transactions were in compliance with the bankâs code of conduct. No trades were made during the Federal Reserveâs blackout period, during which trading activity is prohibited,â the Dallas Fed said in a statement.**  
&gt;  
&gt;All 12 regional Fed banks have provided 2020 financial disclosures for their presidents. Most showed nothing unusual, with little or no trading reported last year.

My thoughts on this hinge around three points:

1. Population growth has peaked. As shown in this [image](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/06/2019-Revision-%E2%80%93-World-Population-Growth-1700-2100-768x547.png), global population growth peaked in the mid-1960s, which was followed by a sharp fall to current levels, and is expected to fall even more quickly in the future. The people born during this peak will soon be exiting the workforce, causing demographic issues across the world - where an increasingly smaller working population has to support an increasingly larger retired population.
2. Energy use must peak in the near future, one way or another. As shown in this [image](https://ourworldindata.org/exports/global-energy-substitution_v4_850x600.svg), our energy use has exploded over the last two centuries, with the overwhelming majority of this energy coming from fossil fuels. We have a very small carbon budget of 440 billion tonnes, which will be depleted by around 2030 at the current rates of use [\[1\]](https://theconversation.com/new-research-suggests-1-5c-climate-target-will-be-out-of-reach-without-greener-covid-19-recovery-plans-151527). Therefore, our consumption of energy must either reduce significantly in the next decade, either by choice, or by the increasing impact of climate change on humanity.
3. Growth and output have peaked. Looking at this [image](https://ourfiniteworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/world-gdp-growth-in-three-alternative-measures.png), we can see that global GDP growth has been on a steady downward trend, and has largely not recovered since 2007. The past decade has been one of ultra-easy monetary policy, intended to stimulate the economy and produce growth. Despite the enormous amounts of stimulus, the global rate of GDP growth has remained anemic, with no signs pointing towards this changing. The rise of China has been a major contributor to global GDP growth since 2007, but there are no signs that this may have also peaked.

Overall, I think that the current state of humanity (circa 1800 - 2021) is a gigantic bubble, driven by easy access to huge amounts of energy, which has enabled enormous population growth and prodigious levels of consumption. However, there are signs that the music is slowing, the conditions that have made this possible are disappearing, and the bubble is showing signs of popping. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

I have been averaging into Draftkings as a long term position, but have found that I also enjoy swing trading the stock due to the fact that I have been holding it and have become rather familiar with its movements/patterns. I purchased a few extra shares back in May around $42-$43 for the sake of reselling sometime in the near future around 60. The plan worked as expected and I sold a handful of shares yesterday for around 63.50...TDA requires the user to log in the following day to adjust the tax lot method or to assign a sale to a specific purchase. The stock does not settle for a couple days and this can be done anytime prior to settlement after the day the stock was sold. So...With that being said. This is my question...I notice I have shares from back in March of this year as well with a higher average of around $60. I have my other shares from May and they have an average of $43. My main position was purchased awhile ago (last year), and is averaged around 50 with shares purchased all over the place. I guess I am wondering if it would be wise to sell the shares purchased at $60 back in March instead - I would barely be breaking even on them, locking in next to no profit, but would inadvertently lower my cost basis and would leave the profit I could have taken on the table. This is all for the sake of having those shares for 1+ years and being able to hold them comfortably without having to risk losing any of my initial investment/capital...Or would it be wiser to take the profit I can take off of the shares purchased in May at $40 and simply keep the others until the cost rises. I guess I feel like delaying the profit taking until the shares have matured in my portfolio for a year or more would be wise so I am not paying as much tax? If i take profit now I pay the tax on it. If I sell my higher cost shares and just barely break even (nothing to pay tax on here).

The bankâs global investment committee expects a stock-market pullback of 10% to 15% before the end of the year, she wrote.

âThe strength of major U.S. equity indexes during August and the first few days of September, pushing to yet more daily and consecutive new highs in the face of concerning developments, is no longer constructive in the spirit of âclimbing a wall of worry,ââ said Shalett. âConsider taking profits in index funds,â she said, as stock benchmarks have dismissed âresurgent COVID-19 hospitalizations, plummeting consumer confidence, higher interest rates and significant geopolitical shifts.â

The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.

My thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?

* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few
* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)
* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.
* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't have moat.
* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.
* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.
* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla.

Looking further into it, I couldn't find much about the company (HFTAlert) on Google. It looks phenomenal, but I wanted to be sure beforehand since the price is hefty (~$500/mo).

Looking into other people's tweets to the service, these tweets are claiming the service is simply a rework of the McClellan Oscillator. Now, I want to get the service just to test it out and see if it's actually useful. The track record of the recommended trades seems good, but I don't know what to make of the whole situation. 


I have listed the information from tweets supposedly explaining the situation below. I have a few questions:

1) Is it possible that this trading system is still a useful purchase and can be useful during trades? 

2) Is the entire system solely just the McClellan Oscillator? Is there nothing novel about it versus what can be gained by simply using certain settings on a default McClellan Oscillator?

3) Has anyone tried this service? I would think that something charging such a high price has to deliver a quality service, in my opinion this can't all be so simplistic, there has to be something insightful gained by using this service. I really don't know what to think but I will try these settings described in the below tweets to test it when I have time. Can someone provide some insight after looking into this service??? Thanks in advance. 



Below are summaries of some of the tweets (basically I just typed in HFTAlert McClellan) 


Comparison to freely available software:

- ""This is basically the same thing as the product: tos.mx/ntrqBH ""


The Accumulator

- On Balance Volume for any stock or etf.  Its simply tracking volume on bids and offers.

- Solely from spending 5 minutes on their website the description of the Accumulator is just a plot of the cumulative delta (the pink Accumulator line) and a second line, the cyan one, is a moving average of it. There also seems to be the option to set it to show order book imbalances if the book is heavily stacked one way or another. 


The Delineator:


The delininator value is the Summation Index. Nothing he sells is proprietary. His ""tape reader,"" is just volume measurements in a moving average.""

The Delineator is a breadth based system that uses the McClellan oscillator. Just put it on a 30 min chart. his delineator is the mclellan oscilator smmation index, his ""primary is the MC oscilator on a 30 minute basis, his ""secondary"" is the MC oscilator on a daily basis


The Delineator is a derivation of the McClellan Oscillator. It uses market breadth, not price, to measure and forecast future price direction. But more than a simplistic buy/sell indicator, the Delineator is a process of analysis and decision making that is measurable and repeatable. I designed the Delineator in 1998 when I was a portfolio manager and used it to manage our client's growth portfolios. Maintaining a disciplined approach to the timing of investment decisions is critical to long term success. This is the key benefit of using the Delineator.


McClellan Oscillator:
""HFTALERT simply follows the mcclellan oscillator. When the mcclellan oscillator has a value of +75 or more, he tells you to go long. When it has value of -75 or more, he tells you to go short!""

Cycle Momentum:

""his ""cycle momentum"" is simply the difference in the value from the current 30 minute mclellan oscilator bar to the prior 30 minute mclellan oscilator bar.""

The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.

Here's what I have to say:  


* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few
* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and countless other companies.
* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.
* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard. 
* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla.

I use the services/products from all these companies on a daily or monthly basis. The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. 

For Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.

Some things I've been considering...

&amp;#x200B;

1. There is a possibility that earnings could miss estimates... even though they estimated low, around 225 M for this quarter. This would be due to Peloton shitting the bed. Before the Amazon deal... Peloton was Affirm's largest customer. The Peloton collapse will affect Affirm.
2. According to a Simply Wall Street article anything below $270 M will not be seen by the street as a surprise. So if Affirm beats... it has to be substantial.
3. So much depends on the guidance they will offer and more info about the Amazon deal. I'd like to see what they predict. I believe the guidance regarding this will determine whether or not the SP rises or sinks. Amazon is a monster... and this deal was huge for Affirm.
4. It will be really interesting to see Apple's performance in Canada with PayBright. A company that Affirm acquired. I called my local Apple store (in Canada) and spoke with sales supervisor. They told me approximately 2/10 purchases are funded via Paybright! Anecdotal yes... small sample size.. yes... but you can extrapolate this... something to think about.
5. There is a lot of momentum in this space. We saw this with SQ's all stock offering worth 29 B for After pay.
6. Affirm has been in business since 2012. Think about all that data and analysis they have collected on borrowers! That's a gold mine and in this day and age data analytics is everything. 
7. Which leads me to potential suitors for Affirm... Apple, Shopify, Amazon, WallMArt... hell I bet even JPM is interested. Considering traditional banking will be taken to the cleaners if they don't do anything... soon. My money is on Shop to take them out as they own 8% already.
8. Max Levchin the CEO is switched on. He's been here before and can execute. Just look at PayPal.

I have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. 

The more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. 

But you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing.

Walmart (WMT), also known as the biggest retailer in the United States and the biggest company by revenue. Walmart has rural grocery and retail by the \*explicative\* and has begun to expand into online delivery using its 5500 stores in the United States and another 6100 stores abroad as leverage. Walmartâs pickup is already a huge part of its ecommerce business, and it will only keep exploding with delivery as it introduces its Walmart+ subscription service which includes âfreeâ delivery.

In the past year alone, Walmart has proven that it has much more power to deliver groceries to consumers than even amazon does (especially in rural parts of the country). Online Sales have skyrocketed almost 100% over the past year (97%) and has crushed records in revenue in the process. They are back to repurchasing shares at close to 5 year highs as revenue has increased. CEO McMillon has even said they have gained more market share in their groceries segment.

Sales skyrocketed during the pandemic as Walmart quickly switched to a more touch free environment while reducing capital expenditures. Return on Assets and Return on Investment have stayed relatively steady at roughly 6% and Free Cash Flow rapidly increasing since 2018 while carrying around roughly 10 billion more cash (36 billion total) than last year and roughly 50 billion in long term debt which is only about 2-5 billion in annual payments over the next 5 years (extremely easy to maintain).

In the last couple of quarters Walmart has actually gone down in Free Cash Flow. This is why the stock seems to have hit a brick wall when it comes to its movement up and has yet to hit the highs it hit in 2020 while everything else in the market has seemed to move up. The reason for this you ask? Walmart has started increasing inventories (hence reducing its free cash flow) since January or February of this year.

Now why would Walmart seem to be doing this? Not only is Walmart a consumer staple but Walmart is basically saying it is capitalizing on yesterdayâs prices to increase tomorrows profit. Or Walmart is basically betting on inflation (and they would know as the number one retailer in the United States). Also as supply constraints increase (as so many companies are beginning to face their own denial as to how much shortages are affecting their business) Walmart is actually taking strides to increase profits as prices rise. It is trying to avoid the shortages that it faced in 2020 by learning from 2020 and prepping for the 2nd half of 2021. This makes Walmart one of the ultimate hedges against inflation.

Well, we donât want to pay too much for an inflation hedge do we? Well, we are in luck, Walmart seems to have an intrinsic value of about $175/share. If Walmart is able to use its inventories and leverage its prices lower than competitors it might have one of the strongest economic moats going into the 2nd half of this year. With the large liquidity in Walmart, call options probably wouldnât be the worst idea as well. It also seems like it might be building enough momentum to break that $151 resistance. Iâm excited for Wal-Marts future. Let me know your thoughts?

â¼ï¸If you know what Discovery+ is scroll past first paragraph.â¼ï¸

So many people have come to terms and recognize that the TV industry is dying and streaming services are taking over. Discovery recognized this and took matters into there own hands. Discovery owns many different channels like; HGTV, food network, animal planet, a stake in A&amp;E, History, Travel, Sci, and many others. So what they have done is taken these channels and put them into a streaming service called Discovery+. So why would people buy Discovery+ when they could buy Netflix, Disney Plus or any of the other streaming services? Well this is mainly because it is only $4.99 a month. Alright so if you are new to discovery, that should clear things up a little bit.

The second reason he bought discovery is because of there fantastic business model which allows them to make huge amounts of cash and massive profits. In the first half of 2021 discovery generated $757 million in free cash flow. THIS WAS MORE THAN NETFLIX $500 MILLION! Discovery only made $6 billion in revenue while Netflix made $14 billion and still had more free cash flow. Discoveryâs market cap is $14 billion and Netflix is $260 billion. The market is pricing discovery like it is a dying business!! Keep in mind, Discovery+ is not even valued into the $14 billion market cap.

NETFLIX BUSINESS MODEL:

Netflix has licensed and produced content, and the revenue they make goes back into producing more scripted content or renewing licenses.   
 
DISCOVERY BUSINESS MODEL:

Discovery just produces the content and then SALES IT TWICE to tv channels and discovery+. This doubles itâs value and they donât even have to pay for licensing which brings in much more revenue.

As of august 13 the stock was shorted 19%. This does give it enough potential to have a short squeeze, which is just another upside to buying the stock.

Discovery is going to be merging with Warner bros. The merger will be taking the price of DISCA, so If you have the ticker DISCK you kill make an extra dollar per share. This merger will give it an amazing opportunity to compete against Netflix and Disney plus. Warner bros will be bringing many series and great movies to the table. This is going to be everything a family needs and is bound to grow. They are expected to have 100 million subscribers once the merger goes through. Overall, there are just so many upsides to this stock and I canât wait to see what the future holds. 

This was typed out very fast so sorry for any typos.

I've been researching **DraftKings** and the **sports-betting industry** for a while now.  
gotta say I really liked what I found, and I think it could be a great long-term investment opportunity... but still wanted to hear people's thoughts about $DKNG.

# THE ONLINE BETTING INDUSTRY

# The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023âgrowing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

&amp;#x200B;

# DraftKings

DraftKings is a *sports betting*, *daily fantasy sports contest*, and an *iGaming* operator.

In total, DraftKings now operates sportsbooks in **14 states** and averages **1.5 million monthly unique paying customers** across its online sportsbooks, iGaming, and daily fantasy offerings.

# Financials

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

*Comparison of DraftKings's revenue, Cost of revenue, and net profit -* [*JIKA.IO*](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/DKNG/DraftKings/Revenue?ref=dkngreddit) 

 

Another positive point in DraftKings's favor is the amount of cash the company has gathered since 2018. The company currently has $2.65 billion in cash, which compared to last year's results - $1.24 billion, is a 113% change.

According to this [article](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in-ecuador-2021-08-09), âThe decree lays out a clear action plan and timeframe that has a primary objective of developing an efficient, environmentally and socially responsible mining industry in Ecuador, to promote national and foreign investment and to implement the best practices for the exploitation of these resources.â

To be honest, I am not surprised by this knowing how supportive the president is when it comes to bringing in more investors to the country. He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.

Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resourcesâ ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/)) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. Their stocks have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.

SolGold ([SOLG.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/)), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. 

But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuadorâs economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3025240,public,self,The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect companies,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjo8m9/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/,all_ads,6,discussion,8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b,Industry Discussion,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'wy44EUMM8Egc2kF6NZRDc7gLMLSjNPoGnW4qmFOIzLM', 'resolutions': [{'height': 60, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5898a2df77b91f5e25b93fe0c649e6dedc4f2962', 'width': 108}, {'height': 121, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0d729ed89b4c0c43218b9382f7f6af8f7ae4d35', 'width': 216}, {'height': 180, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711613554f270c6c82b23fb65153055c9af38089', 'width': 320}, {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=547c68556d489c11adc17b4c0c13d595c6f6e1dc', 'width': 640}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f5ce6acc35e953cc54c1de18cd43c0b50098cdb', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 575, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bgh-oz9Q3tjkaFo94KBmLNlHtOfqjjHirs8UW5SdCUg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8adabe341d1320da2e666fb149e76e271ece7104', 'width': 1022}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

Its another beautiful week to make some money and boy do we have a list for you! 
Now before we begin as always, I want to make sure that I say this, so no one comes after me so please read this carefully when I say if you donât have the money, or you donât want to lose money then please do not trade in the market and do not dump all your money into the stocks that are listed in this article! Just because I am writing about them does not guarantee they will go up, down or even move for that matter, the objective of this this weekly draft is to pick stocks that I think might have the best movement and potential, but with the stock market even with all the facts there is no guarantee that it will go your way. 
Now, lets get into it, to start off Adamis pharmaceuticals ($ADMP). Never heard of them? Thatâs because they are not brother or sister to a company like Pfizer this is more like a second cousin once removed. Just trading at a low price of $1.11 youâre most likely thinking why? Well, what they lack in price they make up in rumors and rumors have it that Adamis are currently in trials with an antiviral drug for upper respiratory infections such as asthma, influenza and covid-19 called tempol, they have already announced dosing patients and are on their II/III phase putting them directly under the microscope as a potential 10x if it goes that way.
Another unsuspecting stock is Alcoa Corp ($AA). Now ill admit this one is a bit of a no brainer, but I figured why not just be captain obvious for the people who may not always research their stocks before diving right in. The only reason I even came across this stock was because I was looking for information on Coco Cola and found that the beverage company is suffering from a shortage of cans and is having a hard time maintain the amount of aluminum. Furthermore, this isnât just in Coco Colas back door but its apparently a global issue with aluminum making it rarer and less accessible to everyone. The stock is currently trading at $47.21 and if the shortage continues its only going to drive the price of shares up. 
This next stock you know and love, its one of the top tech companies please put your hands together for Apple Corp everyone! ($AAPL) Is pretty much the dominating giant when it comes to phones in the west and Apple have continued to deliver with the new iPhone 13. What makes this release a shocker is that apple have hinted or maybe just confirmed at this point that the new iPhones will be able to use satellite communications making it essentially the first smart satellite phone to hit the market, whatâs interesting is that space corporations are jumping on this and a buddy of mine even said âLooks like the astronauts are all getting iPhones now.â A wild statement but not something I couldnât imagine apple wanting to dominate. First earth then the universe. Apple is trading as of right now just $154.30
Still rolling with communications next in line is apples former king the company that shaped my childhood and phone status with its beautifully designed flip phone, thatâs right next we have Motorola ($MSI) despite not being top shit when it comes to how cool your phone is Motorola has managed to stay afloat and prosper while not being in the spotlight. The company has shown tremendous earnings and revenue over the years and donât seem to be slowing in the growth and development department even with the uncertainty we live in today, trading at a decent $244.85 stock has taken a small dive but in the great words of capitalism buy low sell high. 
Okay, I need to come clean, I didnât want to put this in here just because of how much everyone talks about it already, but I could not pass it up. Tesla, thatâs right the real-life stark industries has made headlines once again thanks to the real-life Tony Stark Mr. Elon Musk. And what did Mr. Musk do? Oh, nothing just stated that Teslas shares could easily be worth $3000 a piece. Now for those of you who are saying big deal its just talk let me remind you that we are talking about a man that tweeted that Teslaâs stock price was too high and by the end of the day Teslaâs share price had shot down so many people were wondering if it was a crash all over again. The man literally made a crypto that was started as a joke rise to nearly .40 cents a coin when it was trading at .003 in just a few months. It may be nothing buts itâs a nothing I canât ignore and thatâs why its on the list today. Tesla is currently trading at $733.57 a share. 
And there you have it the draft is over and well see whatâs in store for these stocks at the end of the week with the review that comes out after the market closes on Friday EST.

In 2020, when Teslaâs stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was âtoo highâ. It sent Teslaâs stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: âOur estimate for Teslaâs success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,â In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. Thatâs a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Arkâs new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: âIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.â A $3,000 share price would put Teslaâs valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrekâs Take

Since Arkâs new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Muskâs email is basically a direct comment on Teslaâs stock price. He believes that âif executed really wellâ, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Had a look at some individual stocks, but the results are mixed so I can't draw a final conclusion. 

The question is - an outperformer (market is at +5%, he is at +10/15/25%) going to harder than the market or not? Let's assume the stock is at +25% compared to SPY in the last year. If big boss Powell decides tomorrow that he wants to stop the printing money machine and the market drops, which scenario is most plausible?

Scenario A - market drops 10% in the next 3 months, stocks goes from +25% to -25%, so it has a bigger drop than the market. The logic behind this scenario is the fact that the stock behind so far ahead of the market, it might be overextended/overpriced more than the rest.

Scenario B - market drops 10%, stock goes from +25% to -10%, so it reaches the same level as the market. Smaller drop than Scenario A, pretty much the same logic, just that is more of a correction and a mean reversion.

Scenario C - market drops 10%, stocks goes from +25% to +10%, so it remains an outperformer. Logic in this is that the stock reached +25% because it's an extremely good company and it has a fair evaluation (so it was undervalued before this run) so even if the market drops, it will remain above the market level.

&gt;As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a "".com"" suffix in its name. Venture capital was easy to raise. Investment banks, which profited significantly from initial public offerings (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.\[12\] A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the priceâearnings ratio, and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a stock market bubble.\[10\]

The Hard Data

U/-Z1-

# ""Yes, a Gamma squeeze can occur""

\- Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners, clarifying his view on BBIG after his CNBC interview ([9/1/2021](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1433060509679591425?s=20))

&amp;#x200B;

Hello fellow short squeeze enthusiasts, hope you had restful weekends!I strongly believe that BBIG will have a huge move up sooner than the other short squeeze candidates. BBIG's situation has changed rapidly, and a lot has come to light.I wanted to share a data-based summary of some of the important factors I see leading it to an imminent move. No subjective TA, no baseless pumping, and no magical elliot waves:

&amp;#x200B;

# Share Availability Crisis

* Demand has soared for shares to borrow, prompting lenders to get more and more shares to loan out.  As short sellers have soaked up all that supply of shares available to loan, lenders have been struggling to find more shares to loan. BBIG has become a *very* ""hard to borrow"" stock.
* Brokers are desperate to find shares to loan out, and the situation has gotten worse by the day. Fidelity started emailing BBIG holders, offering them huge rewards if they loan out their shares. About this, [Will Meade said](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1431310134316347397?s=20) "" if the biggest broker by assets does not have $BBIG shares no one does.""
* **Major share scarcity = extra demand = upward pressure on stock price.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Gamma Squeezes Incoming

* The number of in-the-money call options expiring 9/17 has reached *100,000*! That's enormous for a float this small. It's up to 10 million shares that could be purchased, and this requires options sellers to buy up a ton of shares to hedge their positions. The week of 9/13 to 9/17 will see a lot of forced buying pressure!
* Whales have been buying huge quantities of options lately, so that number is going to be much greater by then!
* Next week will see some delta hedging too, especially if/when the stock price climbs to bring more options in-the-money.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short Exempt Volume

* BBIG has spent a lot of time with SSR in effect, yet shorts kept piling on, often in the form of short exempt volume. [Jason Polun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nHDW4ajuw) dug up exactly how much this amounted to, and it's insane:
   * 8/27 - 2.6 million
   * 8/30 - 1.06 million
   * 8/31 - 2.5 millionâ ï¸
   * 9/1 - 8.4 millionâ ï¸
   * 9/2 - 1.06 million
   * 9/3 - 1.5 million
* This type of shorting creates tons of FTDs, and prime brokers have 6 days to settle those (market makers get 12).
* **Tuesday, 9/7** is when the largest number of these need to be settled by prime brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Similar to AMC and SPRT just before their run-ups

* AMC and SPRT had high utilization of borrowed shares and high short exempt volume just before they had their huge run-ups. That is exactly how BBIG is set up right now!

&amp;#x200B;

# No Share Offerings

* Many squeezes are held back by new share offerings that put a damper on the momentum. That is not the case with BBIG. They stated that they do not want to raise more money, and they have held true to that, even in the midst of this rise in price.
* The two SEC filings on Friday are ***not*** new offerings, and they are ***not*** any kind of new dilution (as bears would like you to believe). They are actually *amendments* to old warrant registrations that were registered a long time ago ([explanation with links here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/comments/phgszx/the_424b3_filings_nothing_to_worry_about_not_new/)).

&amp;#x200B;

# Institutions Are Long

* [Institutions started increasing their long positions](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig) en masse back in March, and they have continued to raise their stakes. The vast majority of them are *long*.
* *Why is this so important?* It means that most of the shorts are smaller sellers who are **much** more likely to be get squeezed as the price goes up. Among the squeeze candidates, BBIG is most likely to have a ***double*** squeeze (gamma squeeze and short squeeze).

&amp;#x200B;

# BBIG - Now the True Anatomy of a Meme Stock Squeeze

* Meme stock run-ups have some elements in common - FOMO and sentiment increases price, shorts pile on, hedging their positions with OTM call options. Price rises further with pressure from many factors, causing delta hedging and FOMO, forcing options sellers to hedge even more. As this cycle continues, smaller short sellers feel pressure and some have to cover.
* BBIG's near-100 Fintel short squeeze score, high option open interest, high call/put ratio, high short exempt volume, max utilization of loaned shares, high trading volume and bullish sentiment show that **BBIG is at the boiling point**.

Investor buys far OTM â¬ï¸
https://mobile.twitter.com/rickyschrdr/status/1433144243284058112

And for those who don't know...
Threshold securities are stocks with more that 0.5% of its outstanding shares in Failures-to-deliver (FTDs) 

FTDs are a symptom of naked shorting, as well as institutions who fail to deliver in-the-money call options or lent shares that were recalled


Short exempts are a special tool of market makers (MMs) to take a short while a stock is on Short-sale restriction (SSR) or to short without locating a share to borrow.

These exemptions are intended for MMs to survive periods of massive volatility and frenzy buying.

However, recently some apes such as myself have identified that short exempts can and have been liberally abused to short stocks without requiring a locate, allowing MMs to drive massive downward pressure on stocks during SSR and to avoid borrowing while making the market.

In situations where MMs are short a stock, they can use exempts to take the other side of retail buy orders to satisfy the trade without having to find another seller. It is massively profitable for them because they can dictate the price on the spread while doing this.

Meanwhile, short MMs can accumulate shares to borrow for later, allowing them to drive the price down during a sell off. Then, they buy back the stock at a discount and deliver on the FTDs created by all the short exempts they made. 

But...

What if the stock doesn't sell off???

You see, every short exempt that was taken without a borrow automatically becomes an FTD because technically it is a naked short. And MMs are only given 6 trading days to settle FTDs.

If they don't, they are forcefully restricted from shorting the stock, halting their trading.

This cuts massively into their profits, so MMs are forced into a prisoner's dilemma of buying back the shares they failed to locate in order to close the FTDs. 

This would naturally go against their trading strategy because their net position is short on the stock they must buy.

Add on top of this, the market maker sold a massive number of call options on that stock which would run in the money, forcing them to delta hedge those positions... by buying more stock...

MMs get around this problem and kick the can down the road for a while by borrowing more shares. This is possible because, according to RegSho, you can close FTDs by borrowing shares, but this only lasts so long because eventually these shares run dry as utilization rises to 100%

Oh but it gets worse for them...

If a stock is on the threshold list and stays there for more than 13 consecutive days...

At any time, regulators are able to force the closure of any existing short positions on that stock.

The MM is then forced to buy to cover their shorts...

What followed was a pure gamma squeeze, rendering MMs helpless but to buy shares at such a rapid pace as to force the price to skyrocket past $59 by that Friday before a sell of saw it settle around $26.

But $SPRT isn't done because shorts still haven't covered.

There is a pattern that I identified where $SPRT had a huge run up leading to it's 21st day on the Threshold list (8/20), but it was rapidly shorted down just before that Friday in order to push expiring options out-the-money (OTM).

The following Monday however...was too much

Now we come to $BBIG, which has been on threshold since 8/3, making this 24 days on the list as of Friday.

We saw yet another massive push to shove the price down and to try to shake out any paper hands. 

Again, we saw an end-of-day rebound for $BBIG after shorts piled on.

Shorts are at over 300% losses on their positions, and now, once again, a massive portion of the float is ITM on the call options chain. Shit is about to go down...

I'm not setting dates, I'm not a financial wizard, and I'm not a fortune teller. I'm just a computer geek that knows how to use a calculator. 

The math is fucking clear.

Shorts are are in deep shit
They can't cover without buying

The Hard Data

U/-Z1-

# ""Yes, a Gamma squeeze can occur""

\- Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners, clarifying his view on BBIG after his CNBC interview ([9/1/2021](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1433060509679591425?s=20))

&amp;#x200B;

Hello fellow short squeeze enthusiasts, hope you had restful weekends!I strongly believe that BBIG will have a huge move up sooner than the other short squeeze candidates. BBIG's situation has changed rapidly, and a lot has come to light.I wanted to share a data-based summary of some of the important factors I see leading it to an imminent move. No subjective TA, no baseless pumping, and no magical elliot waves:

&amp;#x200B;

# Share Availability Crisis

* Demand has soared for shares to borrow, prompting lenders to get more and more shares to loan out.  As short sellers have soaked up all that supply of shares available to loan, lenders have been struggling to find more shares to loan. BBIG has become a *very* ""hard to borrow"" stock.
* Brokers are desperate to find shares to loan out, and the situation has gotten worse by the day. Fidelity started emailing BBIG holders, offering them huge rewards if they loan out their shares. About this, [Will Meade said](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1431310134316347397?s=20) "" if the biggest broker by assets does not have $BBIG shares no one does.""
* **Major share scarcity = extra demand = upward pressure on stock price.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Gamma Squeezes Incoming

* The number of in-the-money call options expiring 9/17 has reached *100,000*! That's enormous for a float this small. It's up to 10 million shares that could be purchased, and this requires options sellers to buy up a ton of shares to hedge their positions. The week of 9/13 to 9/17 will see a lot of forced buying pressure!
* Whales have been buying huge quantities of options lately, so that number is going to be much greater by then!
* Next week will see some delta hedging too, especially if/when the stock price climbs to bring more options in-the-money.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short Exempt Volume

* BBIG has spent a lot of time with SSR in effect, yet shorts kept piling on, often in the form of short exempt volume. [Jason Polun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nHDW4ajuw) dug up exactly how much this amounted to, and it's insane:
   * 8/27 - 2.6 million
   * 8/30 - 1.06 million
   * 8/31 - 2.5 millionâ ï¸
   * 9/1 - 8.4 millionâ ï¸
   * 9/2 - 1.06 million
   * 9/3 - 1.5 million
* This type of shorting creates tons of FTDs, and prime brokers have 6 days to settle those (market makers get 12).
* **Tuesday, 9/7** is when the largest number of these need to be settled by prime brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Similar to AMC and SPRT just before their run-ups

* AMC and SPRT had high utilization of borrowed shares and high short exempt volume just before they had their huge run-ups. That is exactly how BBIG is set up right now!

&amp;#x200B;

# No Share Offerings

* Many squeezes are held back by new share offerings that put a damper on the momentum. That is not the case with BBIG. They stated that they do not want to raise more money, and they have held true to that, even in the midst of this rise in price.
* The two SEC filings on Friday are ***not*** new offerings, and they are ***not*** any kind of new dilution (as bears would like you to believe). They are actually *amendments* to old warrant registrations that were registered a long time ago ([explanation with links here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/comments/phgszx/the_424b3_filings_nothing_to_worry_about_not_new/)).

&amp;#x200B;

# Institutions Are Long

* [Institutions started increasing their long positions](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig) en masse back in March, and they have continued to raise their stakes. The vast majority of them are *long*.
* *Why is this so important?* It means that most of the shorts are smaller sellers who are **much** more likely to be get squeezed as the price goes up. Among the squeeze candidates, BBIG is most likely to have a ***double*** squeeze (gamma squeeze and short squeeze).

&amp;#x200B;

# BBIG - Now the True Anatomy of a Meme Stock Squeeze

* Meme stock run-ups have some elements in common - FOMO and sentiment increases price, shorts pile on, hedging their positions with OTM call options. Price rises further with pressure from many factors, causing delta hedging and FOMO, forcing options sellers to hedge even more. As this cycle continues, smaller short sellers feel pressure and some have to cover.
* BBIG's near-100 Fintel short squeeze score, high option open interest, high call/put ratio, high short exempt volume, max utilization of loaned shares, high trading volume and bullish sentiment show that **BBIG is at the boiling point**.

Investor buys far OTM â¬ï¸

And for those who don't know...
Threshold securities are stocks with more that 0.5% of its outstanding shares in Failures-to-deliver (FTDs) 

FTDs are a symptom of naked shorting, as well as institutions who fail to deliver in-the-money call options or lent shares that were recalled


Short exempts are a special tool of market makers (MMs) to take a short while a stock is on Short-sale restriction (SSR) or to short without locating a share to borrow.

These exemptions are intended for MMs to survive periods of massive volatility and frenzy buying.

However, recently some apes such as myself have identified that short exempts can and have been liberally abused to short stocks without requiring a locate, allowing MMs to drive massive downward pressure on stocks during SSR and to avoid borrowing while making the market.

In situations where MMs are short a stock, they can use exempts to take the other side of retail buy orders to satisfy the trade without having to find another seller. It is massively profitable for them because they can dictate the price on the spread while doing this.

Meanwhile, short MMs can accumulate shares to borrow for later, allowing them to drive the price down during a sell off. Then, they buy back the stock at a discount and deliver on the FTDs created by all the short exempts they made. 

But...

What if the stock doesn't sell off???

You see, every short exempt that was taken without a borrow automatically becomes an FTD because technically it is a naked short. And MMs are only given 6 trading days to settle FTDs.

If they don't, they are forcefully restricted from shorting the stock, halting their trading.

This cuts massively into their profits, so MMs are forced into a prisoner's dilemma of buying back the shares they failed to locate in order to close the FTDs. 

This would naturally go against their trading strategy because their net position is short on the stock they must buy.

Add on top of this, the market maker sold a massive number of call options on that stock which would run in the money, forcing them to delta hedge those positions... by buying more stock...

MMs get around this problem and kick the can down the road for a while by borrowing more shares. This is possible because, according to RegSho, you can close FTDs by borrowing shares, but this only lasts so long because eventually these shares run dry as utilization rises to 100%

Oh but it gets worse for them...

I'm not setting dates, I'm not a financial wizard, and I'm not a fortune teller. I'm just a computer geek that knows how to use a calculator. 

The math is fucking clear.

Whatâs a low cost index fund you guys would recommend for someone that is just starting out and wants to hold for 5-10 years. Would international index fund be less risky?

I am not trying to get the highest returns but more focused on stability because I will need capital in 5-10 years to start a business or invest in better opportunities whenever they arise such as 4plex or something like that. But in the meantime I want to invest in an index fund for the next 5-10 years.

We are long WBA.

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyoneâs portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.

**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**

Below are the 6 main reasons weâre bullish on WBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**

Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.

Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.

WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a âvirtuous cycleâ, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.

In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**

Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBAâs inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **4% Dividend**

A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock marketâs yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.

Its further possible that WBAâs dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Attractive Valuations**

WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.

Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasnât yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.

How do we know itâs cheap? Why is the stock a âbuyâ? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).

In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** **Improving Business**

Walgreensâ business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.

With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBAâs bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )

We will look at the upcoming yearâs revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBAâs progress and performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**

The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.

Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.

There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and itâs been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.

A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.

Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.

Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called âHavenâ) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).

It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3023088,public,self,"Walgreens DD ($WBA): Safe Stock, Selling at a Discount, 4% Dividend, Improving Business --&gt; Price Target $74 (50% upside).",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pj5rdz/walgreens_dd_wba_safe_stock_selling_at_a_discount/,all_ads,6,,1235582c-6848-11eb-96e8-0e132357f477,Company Analysis,,,,,,,,

Happy Labor Day and thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. There has been lots of money to be made of late, but indeed it comes with risks..

Over the past 2 weeks, the market has been making new highs. 2 weeks ago there was a short squeeze on the famous 2 tickers that may cause a ban. Because I have been banned on most subs, I will refrain from mentioning most tickers. I will mention SPRT because it is not OTC, Penny and is over 500 million market capâ¦.. That Friday SPRT rocketed to 60, from weeks ago 5â¦. My question is are you taking part in any of these plays?

There are about 5 tickers within the last 2 weeks that have also gone parabolic. Not every ticker can be a short squeeze and when there are to many tickers for retail nothing can be a short squeeze. Yes, utilization helps, yes, borrowing fees do play a factor and definitely Gamma squeeze \[When options are in the money and forced quick buys\] as well as margin calls. So with all these factors that may drive up the price are you playing it? Is there FOMO if you miss one?

For myself, these have definitely changed the way I trade. I have never traded so many, of what I call grenades in over 20 yearsâ¦..however I do not hold overnight or many days I rather scalp when the volume is hot.

So here's a better more honest analysis of SBC and a look into the companies current prospects.



Firstly regarding Palantir. Their leadership is incredible. 90% commercial growth YoY. 50% overall YoY growth and a guidance of 30% growth through 2025 that is totally sandbagged and going to get beaten easily next earnings. 

They have 0$ in debt.  Zero fucking dollars in debt. 

Roughly 2.5 billion in cash including 50 million in gold because they're so diversified 

Hundreds of millions in start up investments

3.5 billion in remaining money coming in from contracts (meaning they could stop doing business and still pull in 3.5 billion first) 

Stock based compensation has gone down significantly in last two quarters. 

Stock based compensation is completely comparable to other companies in similar fields or in tech. 

It's not just for their executives it's a fantastic way to incentivize all employees existing and future to stay with the company for the long run by granting shares. 

Stock based compensation doesn't equal them selling shares. It means granting shares. You're equating it with mostly Alex Karp and a few other leaders doing PRE SCHEDULED tax sales of shares because he's as part of going public (he has almost 10% ownership) the government is taxing him as if going public means he owes taxes on billions of dollars that he ONLY has in shares. In order to cover this he and others sell shares on a pre determined schedule so they don't go to jail with the IRS.


It has nothing to do with their commitment to the company or their leadership or their faith in the future. If you had any idea what you were talking about you'd realize none of them have really changed their overall stake in the company which is basically what your post alleges is that they're just printing money and getting out dishonestly which couldn't be further from the truth.

Here's one HONEST analysis not hype bear fud. 


Nothing is uniquely negative about PLTRs stock based compensation and it's a very good long term tool for growing a company that has only been public for about a year so what can you really expect at such a stage. It's total dilution amounted to about 10% . Retail traders own 75% of this stock and have sold off well over 10% many times over the FUD from this shitty narrative.

Here's some general insight into the company 


The company is NOT a 20 year company that has never been profitable. What they were doing 20 years ago for the government is barely comparable to the company today. Foundry (their flagship product for both commercial and even government partners) has basically only existed for about 2 years and has even undergone significant improvements even in the last years that will guarantee great margins and efficient delivery. They continually built the company under a growth model taking in revenue, hiring the BEST engineers ask anyone who studied coding and software in any large schools around the country between 2005-now these guys have always had a legendary reputation with engineers students would wear palantir t shirts and shit constantly because they were the place that was actually doing cutting edge software work. They always reinvested over and over growing the government side while working on perfecting their current new products for over a decade making Foundry and the apollo AI framework that now allows them to actually deploy Foundry cheaply. 



Lets even take a look at recent earnings. Quarter prior international growth was 17% So at most recent quarter 28% international growth they posted a pretty excellent QoQ increase. It suggests growth is picking up everywhere. Also I think the fact that they've done immense hiring in the short term plays into both why SBC is being kept high and why some margins were less than Q1. Most of the hiring they've done started in Q2 and only really picked up steam into the middle of the year. Let's also realize that the hiring has been almost entirely focused on distribution employees so they're very clearly moving into much greater expectations and focus of sales than they ever have in the history of their company. Peter Thiel actually has incredibly long explanations of how he thinks the optimal way to build a software companywide is to give as little focus on distribution as possible for as long as possible. This year's hiring is a dramatic indication that they're moving to a new stage as a company. 

Also the fact that their product keeps improving even quarter to quarter. They're constantly saying that they themselves are continually finding new ways and more importantly new industries that Foundry and Appllo can enter and be extremely useful. The perfect example of this was the exciting and very recent development of their meta constellation satellite work that they're now doing. 

I think the reason the stock jumped 10% on earnings and now a lot more since was a direct reaction to the evidence that there is no industry they aren't relevant in for software and they're definitely only at the beginning of entering many industries. 

Recent announcements like Foundry for builders or startups more accurately is another reason for the stocks rise because it was argued for a very long time that they would never be viable at offering their product to anything other than extremely large companies. Most importantly was that at the end of Q1 they announced that they were going to be offering Foundry for free as a way to get it into the hands of more companies it seemed very clear as investors to expect this as a short term damper on margins. The idea is that it would get their product into so many more hands that it would be worth it in the long term with a very obvious temporary effect on margins. The fact that client growth both US AND internationally is accelerating not decelerating points to the idea that their distribution network is at its beginning but it is working and I assert extremely high odds that client growth continues to accelerate for consecutive quarters for a long time. 

They will easily do more than 400 million revenue at next quarters report easily beat guidance and the one benefit to where SBC has been is that it is very likely it decreases potentially even dramatically decreases. Their trajectory is very predictable currently and they are a company that eventually will be a necessity to use if businesses don't want to get out competed. One of their main benefits to their customer companies is increasing margins of customers by finding many inefficiencies so they're one of the few products that can increase your bottom line without making you do anything as a company. This means that even during economic downturn they will be strongly potentially even more in demand because companies will need ways to look better and show cash flow even when consumption declines for periods of time.



If you want to understand the history of the company or what they do they're basically a SaaS company (yes SaaS their margins are good enough and they're only going to improve as they focus more and more outside of government Gotham products) 

Their software allows you to run your company through their platform and it keeps your data completely private. Meaning palantir doesn't see your data and mine information and neither does anyone else. You get better illustrations and representations of your companies affairs and it makes significant insights and determines ways to create better efficiency, heads up preemptive solutions before problems occur, and in many cases can bring so many data sets into play that you can learn things you didnt even know were possible. 

If you want resources for this there are a number of testimonials from customers describing what Foundry does for them on Palantirs youtube

You can go search Tom Nashs video on SkyWise (which is Foundry for airbus). He has a couple of them really incredible deep dive

You can watch their most recent video about meta satellite constellations

They have partners within every industry. Research, academics, science, cancer, genomics, aerospace, literally every military branch, health care both insurance providers and health care providers like the NHS, also NIH, big oil companies like BP, big manufacturers like 3m, faurecia, Rio Tinto mining, John deere, big retailers like bass pro and others even larger, news media companies, robotics, AI, autonomous driving like wejo partnered with gm on that, electronic vehicle startups and even electronic flying vehicle start ups, now satellite companies and US Government satellite ownership even. Do you see where this is going? There's nothing they can't break into and they are what is going to be necessary to have a competitive edge which is why everyone is going to have to use them. 


Which brings me to another point. Palantir doesn't have direct competition. They've explained this many times and anyone who says they are a snowflake competitor doesn't understand them as a company at all. Their competition is potential clients who choose to attempt to make an in house software to glean insights into their own data and structure it uniquely for their own needs. This is Palantirs biggest ""competition"" and they will crush it. That kind of work often takes years and is extremely expensive. Just the time that Palantir can save companies and the headaches of making all the mistakes that come with originally building a software like that makes Palantir worth it. 

They have incredible partnerships with Amazon and IBM for new and important distribution channels for getting their products out and quickly and have stated many times that they can deploy their software completely remotely cutting out the old concern that they will never scale because they need forward deployed engineers to set up software. They still use those but I think it's heavily around massive clients and particularly US gov gotham products not Foundry as we now know it. 

Sick of this ridiculous SBC destroying value garbage narrative. We'll see how much value is destroyed in a year when their stock explodes and you'll be wishing you didn't listen to the geniuses who thought they caught Palantir swindling everyone. Also all the people who didn't get swindled by the bear narratives this year are fucking happy as hell because most of them have at least doubled their positions over the last 6 months as the stock constantly traded in a holding pattern. 

Last point is its holding key resistance right now could easily break out in the short term towards 30$ or beyond. Don't say I didn't warn you. If it holds this 26$ mark and doesn't break down below it this month you'll never see PLTR under 24 dollars again and after next earnings I guarantee you'll never see it under 30$ again.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3022383,public,self,Palantir stock based compensation rebuttal and general analysis,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/piysfx/palantir_stock_based_compensation_rebuttal_and/,all_ads,6,tickerdiscussion,612ee368-65e6-11e5-b53f-129e4297eb59,Company Discussion,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '6YuAYV5yPP33nSwjMn14MqSOYKwQWdVqqMR5LeiprkQ', 'resolutions': [{'height': 82, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c6FJsyLKdq2kYJp8SVvC8t19Ro6LRAMBdyN_iw5vcaQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f08bf3eb94a8dee069d935ec2744fbf98f8db0', 'width': 108}, {'height': 165, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c6FJsyLKdq2kYJp8SVvC8t19Ro6LRAMBdyN_iw5vcaQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d583bd934ca68cd2c88fc39817c12f7b9fe3ffc', 'width': 216}, {'height': 244, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c6FJsyLKdq2kYJp8SVvC8t19Ro6LRAMBdyN_iw5vcaQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca881f6d85ad443b7295c7561ebf7fc1beadbde6', 'width': 320}, {'height': 489, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c6FJsyLKdq2kYJp8SVvC8t19Ro6LRAMBdyN_iw5vcaQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04cf755d81959a53fa62c861e41cf2b336c8086', 'width': 640}], 'source': {'height': 587, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/c6FJsyLKdq2kYJp8SVvC8t19Ro6LRAMBdyN_iw5vcaQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=58cb4f377e79ece5fee4bb3fa86e09671dc802b2', 'width': 768}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,

I am not invested but I do plan to be invested in WMT.

Walmart (WMT), also known as the biggest retailer in the United States and the biggest company by revenue. Walmart has rural grocery and retail by the \*explicative\* and has begun to expand into online delivery using its 5500 stores in the United States and another 6100 stores abroad as leverage. Walmartâs pickup is already a huge part of its ecommerce business, and it will only keep exploding with delivery as it introduces its Walmart+ subscription service which includes âfreeâ delivery.

In the past year alone, Walmart has proven that it has much more power to deliver groceries to consumers than even amazon does (especially in rural parts of the country). Sales have skyrocketed almost 100% over the past year (97%) and has crushed records in revenue in the process. They are back to repurchasing shares at close to 5 year highs as revenue has increased. CEO McMillon has even said they have gained more market share in their groceries segment.

Sales skyrocketed during the pandemic as Walmart quickly switched to a more touch free environment while reducing capital expenditures. Return on Assets and Return on Investment have stayed relatively steady at roughly 6% and Free Cash Flow rapidly increasing since 2018 while carrying around roughly 10 billion more cash (36 billion total) than last year and roughly 50 billion in long term debt which is only about 2-5 billion in annual payments over the next 5 years (extremely easy to maintain).

In the last couple of quarters Walmart has actually gone down in Free Cash Flow. This is why the stock seems to have hit a brick wall when it comes to its movement up and has yet to hit the highs it hit in 2020 while everything else in the market has seemed to move up. The reason for this you ask? Walmart has started increasing inventories (hence reducing its free cash flow) since January or February of this year.

Now why would Walmart seem to be doing this? Not only is Walmart a consumer staple but Walmart is basically saying it is capitalizing on yesterdayâs prices to increase tomorrows profit. Or Walmart is basically betting on inflation (and they would know as the number one retailer in the United States). Also as supply constraints increase (as so many companies are beginning to face their own denial as to how much shortages are affecting their business) Walmart is actually taking strides to increase profits as prices rise. It is trying to avoid the shortages that it faced in 2020 by learning from 2020 and prepping for the 2nd half of 2021. This makes Walmart one of the ultimate hedges against inflation.

Well, we donât want to pay too much for an inflation hedge do we? Well, we are in luck, Walmart seems to have an intrinsic value of about $175/share. If Walmart is able to use its inventories and leverage its prices lower than competitors it might have one of the strongest economic moats going into the 2nd half of this year. With the large liquidity in Walmart, call options probably wouldnât be the worst idea as well. It also seems like it might be building enough momentum to break that $151 resistance. Iâm excited for Wal-Marts future. Let me know your thoughts?

For background, I'm a 25-year-old working a minimum wage job but am setting aside 30% of each paycheck for investing since it would be better off in the market than sitting around in my bank account.

10% VOO for broad market

10% IWF for broad market

20% VXUS for international

20% IWM for small/mid-cap

10 % XLF for financial

10 % XLK for technology

10 % XLU for utilities

10 % XLRE for real state

I really like both VOO and IWF but don't want to focus on one or another, so decided to do 10% each even though there is some overlap. Should I choose one and put 20% in it instead of splitting it between two?

I put an equal amount an international exposure and small/mid-cap to match the board market. VXUS because it is really the staple international ETF I could think of. Choosing IWM for a mix of small and mid-cap stocks instead of choosing several different ETFs for each cap, seems like it would be better that way in one ETF instead of splitting it into two.

Then 10% in four sectors, I really like compared to others. I do believe tech is a good play for the long term and feel that financials and utilities would be good for a more stable portfolio with real estate for a more wildcard with some dividends in it.

Katapult Holdings is a subprime fintech company that provides credit in a lease-to-own format and is partnered with Affirm in the Affirm Connect ecosystem. 

Both companies share the same transparency format when giving out a loan, as opposed to the fine print and hidden fees of credit card companies. When Affirm gets a request from a borrowers who are not prime, instead of turning them away they send the customer to Katapult. They get a fee while Katapult takes on the client and assumes the loan and the risk involved with it (subprime). 

While Katapult doesn't have access to all Affirms clients, that is because they are not needed to a large extent in the current Affirm ecosystem. Peloton represents 1/3 of Affirm's revenue, and people who buy $2500 overpriced static bikes are not subprime borrowers.

One example of the Affirm - Katapult partnership can be seen in Gazelle, a marketplace that sells electronic goods and is partnered with Affirm.

[https://buy.gazelle.com/pages/financing](https://buy.gazelle.com/pages/financing)

In this page you can see that if the customer is not approved by Affirm they get a chance with Katapult. The partnership is beneficial to both sides, as Affirm is able to make succulent commission from subprime borrowers (much, much higher than prime borrowers) while having 0 risk on their balance sheet.

With the recent Amazon deal, questions have been raised whether Katapult would be in or left out of the deal, whether Affirm would send ""bad"" customers to Katapult or simply turn them away. 

Subprime has a bad reputation, not only because it was one of the prime reasons for the 2008 global financial meltdown, but because subprime customers are often abused with predatory rates from lending companies who  take advantage of them as their only option. But the truth is that Katapult is the opposite of that. While rates are high (in order to compensate for defaults), customers are given 3 friendly options to pay their loan and  all of these options are transparently presented to them before they take on the loan. This has earned them a 4.4 stars (out of 5) in TrustPilot based on more than 15.000 reviews. 

Given that Katapult is not some shady abuser lending company with hidden fees and fine prints, Affirm decided to partner with them around 2019. But the million dollar question is, will Katapult receive Amazon customers from Affirm?

Of course nobody knows and the question will probably get answered in Affirm earnings call (Wednesday of next week). 

But, with 35% of America being subprime, one thing is for sure. Affirm will get thousands of subprime applications on Amazon, and it will be up to them to accept  and redirect those into Katapult or simply turn them away. Taking into consideration that prime borrowers are much less profitable than subprime, Affirm would be a fool to turn them aways, since for them is basically free money with 0 risk. 

Just to understand how profitable subprime borrowers are, Katapult made $22M  profit on 220M revenues in 2020, while Affirm lost -$112M with $509M revenues in 2020.

Given Affirm rich valuation, any additional revenue that helps boost the bottom line should be more than welcomed, and the partnership with Katapult is a no brainer.

Yea, CLOV is a meme-stock. It is hyped up a lot. I jumped all-in from their hyper-growth numbers (140%) with high SI (15%). As I learn more about their Clover Assistant Software the happier I get just for the fact this is sounding like an awesome long-term investment with real disruptor tech.

It's a SaaS. They have [developer docs](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/developers) on it. Filed 2 patents: 1) ""Models for utilizing siloed data"" and 2) ""Clustering data regarding health care providers"". Integrating Thyme's cancer management software into Clover Assistant. ValueH licensed to use Clover Assistant in Florida. From Clover's Reddit AMA, they stated:

1. "" through the Clover Assistant we have the capability to scale like software to superpower all physicians with great tools.""
2. ""Do you see the Clover Assistant being utilized outside of Medicare or the USA in the future? Meaning, is there potential for it to be software as a service?""  
 Andrew: ""Absolutely"".

I see a Healthcare Management Cloud Software which integrates more than just billing and record management. From their patents and recently Thyme cancer smart system integration, this SaaS platform is an open framework where all kinds of healthcare specialty Big Data/AI smart systems can integrate into super powering the physicians. Look at their patents, they have worked on how to integrate siloed data systems so IP is protected while the results feed into Clover Assistant. The benefits from this healthcare cloud bigdata framework is enormous. I can't wait for their presentation at the 2021 Wells Fargo Virtual Health care Conference on Thursday, Sep 9 at 3:20pm.

If this is a SaaS maybe Clover will eventually have that type of evaluation. When I look at HUBS, UPST , SNOW, MNDY, ... I get jacked about the potential.

Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.

We all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called âPlaysâ this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!

Please try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:

My 5 as a Day Trader:

RKT â This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar

UWMC â This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents

TIGR â This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)

CPNG â I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)

CRSR â I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)

These are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore

BILL â This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100â¦ I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it

MRNA â I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100â¦

SE â I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus

CMG â OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 sharesâ¦ What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????

ZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!

I am sorry but we all must take some losses, though none of us like to, and many of us fail to admit we have losses. I figured a post like this can help one another, or can give us ideas on when to take a loss, why and how.

Everyone has a different plan, agenda and goals. So please do share or also give me some ideas, so maybe it will help my repertoire. For myself, taking a loss on a stock has nothing to do with the stock price and has everything to do with actual performance of a company. Yes, it does suck to be down on a stock, but I will not panic sell a stock, when the company is doing amazing. I usually give a company 1 earnings report if there was a slight miss or the report was okay, to see if the company can come back, and the stock can hopefully rally. If the report was very bad, to me that signals a possible turn around or a 6-12 month wait. If the report is bad I will cut my losses and move on.

It is usually the case after a bad report, an analyst doesnât want to seem so wrong and they immediately come in and down grade a stock bringing further negative sentiment. This negative sentiment can last very long. A good example is RAD, it took 10 weeks and I was finally up on RAD and sold for a small profit. But 10 weeksâ¦..Luckily for me, I did not need the money for something elseâ¦

Which goes into opportunity cost, if I needed the money I would probably take many losses because as the saying goes, cut your losers and buy winners. This goes into the positive momentum, green candles on charts. This is right, but what a chart does is try and show you sentiment in a stock and when it is starting to change. If you are down 50 cents on a play, but can make 1 dollar on the next cut your losses.

The main reason a successful trader/investor wants to take losses is tax harvesting. Imagine if by December 31st, all the positions you closed were winners and say you made 100,000â¦. You had unrealized losses of 50,000â¦. Do you know that you will have to pay taxes on the whole 100,000!? So December I will take losses to offset gains. Yes, if you take losses next year it can count against those gains with an additional 3,000 loss that can be used towards regular incomeâ¦. However you already paid Uncle Sam..

This is why I believe Seagate's earning will suffer on going forward basis and it is because of collapse of ""investment product that shall not be named"" price.

In May 2021, ""investment product that shall not be named"" was launched with little fanfare, but not in tech community where it led to shortage of both SSD and HDD in the market, resulting in both increase of demand and increase of pricing.

Well... After few months of excitements, there has been gradual deflation of price of ""investment product that shall not be named"" where now price is range bound around $200 and netspace of ""investment product that shall not be named"" is stabilizing. This implies artificial spike in demand of both SSD and HDD have disappeared, which will eventually impact Seagate's earnings.

**Thesis Overview**

I have been interested in exploring asset plays since reading âOne Up on Wall Streetâ. I discovered this company recently. Iâm curious how viable people think this might be and if anyone has other ideas for asset plays I can look into.

**Business Overview**

âFranklin Street Properties Corp. (FSP) (NYSE American: FSP) based in Wakefield, Massachusetts, is focused on infill and central business district (CBD) office properties in the U.S. Sunbelt and Mountain West, as well as select opportunistic markets. Approximately 79% of our total owned portfolio, was located in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis.â

**The company operations**

Nothing spectacular. They were beaten down prior to the pandemic and have been hit even harder by the pandemic as a commercial real estate REIT. They are operating cash flow positive for now, but falling short of dividend payouts without property sales.

**Asset Play Thesis**

Their balance sheet shows real estate assets worth $1.4B (minus depreciation). This is at cost and doesnât account for gains in property value. Debt is about $812M. They currently operate 29 properties, which are only leased 79.5% which is a decline from 85% from Dec 2020. They sold 3 properties in May for 219.5M and net gain of 22.7M (11.5% profit). Also sold a Virginia property around that time for a 2.1M loss. They used these proceeds to reduce their debt. 

They have 2 transactions pending for properties sells. Two properties in VA for $40M (25% more than book value) and two in Missouri for 67M (55% more than book value). Also, one of the VA properties is unleased as it was under redevelopment, so shouldnât impact NOI.

Most of their property has been owned by them for at least 10 year. Some over 20 years, so the book value of their real estate is likely less than actual value. Iâm estimating the low end of real estate value is the book value which is 1.4B. My base case (based on previous asset sales) is that itâs worth 10% more than book value or about 1.55B. Best case itâs worth 20% more than paper value, which is 1.69B. These are rough estimates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Market cap at $4.43 per share is 475M.**

Worst case net value of property less debt is 1.4B- 812M= $588M (24% more than market cap)

Base Case net value of property less debt is 1.55B-812M= $738M (55% more than market cap)

Best case net value of property less debt is $878M. (84% more than market cap)

&amp;#x200B;

**At Price of $4.00 per share market cap is 429M.**

Worst case net value of property less debt is 1.4B- 812M= 588M (37% more than market cap)

Base Case net value of property less debt is 1.55B-812M= 738M (72% more than market cap)

Best case net value of property less debt is 878M. (104% more than market cap)

&amp;#x200B;

**Turnaround Play?** 

Covid numbers have peaked in the South which make up a significant portion of their portfolio. Minnesota and Colorado are approaching their peak based on rate of transmission. Covid will likely be something we learn to live with, so it is unlikely we will continue current posture for another 2-3 years. They have also seen an increase in the amount of people interested in leasing and our expecting to increase occupancy the rest of the year. This is probably optimistic and I wouldnât expect this to happen until summer of 2022 based on covid trends. Current occupancy is at about 78.5% with 99.5% of rent collected.

They have been selling their properties with lower NOI, so operating income shouldnât be impaired too badly going forward. In addition, they have $50M that they may put towards buy backs which is over 10% of current market cap. Assuming opportunistic asset allocation and continued covid reopening, FFO per share should improve going forward leading to share price appreciation. They have had insider buying down to about $5 with the last purchases in May, which is a good sign.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

Their properties may not be worth as much as their current balance sheet values claim. This doesnât appear to be the case based on their sales so far, which have largely been at least a 10% gain over book value.

They go bankrupt and have to sell their properties on weakness. Doesn't seem likely based on deleveraging and their current effectiveness at selling properties at profit, but it is a possibility.

Covid fears continue for longer than 2-3 years and people continue to work from home. Doesnât seem likely based on covid fatigue that is already present. 

Work from home is here to stay. This is sizeable risk to their property values, though many employers and employees prefer to work in person. Their core geographies are in rapidly growing cities, so they may be less impacted than less attractive cities. There will likely be hybrid options going forward, which will include in person work.

Dividend is about $38M per year now. Could be faced with another need to cut their dividend or the dividend could cause them to have difficulties surviving until post pandemic. Factors to consider include share buybacks effectively lowering their dividend without needing a cut and debt expense will be lower since they are deleveraging. May find themselves in a situation where they are continuing to sellproperties to continue to survive, which benefits investors as current asset prices are significantly more valuable than their market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

**My play**

This could be an interesting asset play or turnaround. Iâd prefer it to be closer to $4.00 to improve margin of safety. I may sell puts to lower the cost basis or wait to see if the price keeps dropping. They should be able to weather the pandemic with continued property sales. In addition, they are deleveraging significantly and have FFO above breakeven. I expect this to turnaround in the next 3 years. This is not a long-term hold and I would sell in the $7-8 range.",True,False,False,stocks,t5_2qjfk,3018746,public,self,Commercial real estate as an asset play?

We have quite low reported inflation (2-3 %) in various countries where central banks print money and have low base rates (US, European countries, etc).

This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldnât believe. I turned around and said âSirâ¦ Iâm sorry, what did you just say?â He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of foodâ¦he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.

Soâ¦when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading atâ¦Iâm sure itâs bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. Iâm not jokingâ¦at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high. I couldnât fucking believe it. At that moment I knewâ¦we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if Iâm wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA  firstâ¦which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

This was yesterday, Friday, September 3. 

$SPY is at a critical resistance levelâ¦I meanâ¦it literally is hitting the fucking roof hereâ¦ and with everything going on in the worldâ¦you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubbleâ¦but how was that even theoretically feasible? Itâs impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain whyâ¦

              Updated GDP Forecasts

Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secretâ¦THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! 

For fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

âThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.â 

I canât make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to readâ¦ I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. Iâm actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally readâ¦I wish I was joking. Whateverâ¦weird. 

Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. Soâ¦yeah weâre fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companieâs future earningsâ¦ and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations nowâ¦

                     Lumber/Gold Ratio

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

The lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 monthsâ¦literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Rememberâ¦play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. Butâ¦gold was up big this week as wellâ¦and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.

Soâ¦for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boyâ¦were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9â¦.a very surprising miss. I wasnât surprised at all to be honest with you. 


                      Conclusion

Let me be clearâ¦I personally donât believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I donât want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do Iâll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. 

Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. 

No big deal right?

No big deal right?

Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi

No big deal right? 

I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and onâ¦. But you get the point by nowâ¦letâs not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, Iâm sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. 

Nowâ¦my positions. Take this into considerationâ¦ Iâm 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. Soâ¦Not financial advice. 

Short term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

Long term: 

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocksâ¦ I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. Itâs holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle Iâm wrong) 

My last position:

$2,500 in Cash.

Simply putâ¦cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companiesâ¦ my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust meâ¦ I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossibleâ¦but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. Itâs hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be.

Maybe because it was considered penny cuz it was, duh, worth pennies! SORRY MODS! 

Trying to continue that question/topic so I can learn better: I know I cannot buy these shares (bummer!). But is it common for delisted companies that retail cannot buy to jump up so big? I mean, these companies are ""bankrupt"" and facing liquidation, so they technically should not go up at all. Whatever is remaining should be sold to pay down debt, etc. In fact, if facing liquidation, why are they trading in the first place, even if it's in the ""OTC""? Retail cannot buy in, so, who is gaining from BLIAQ and SHLDQ going up?  

\-------------------

NOTE: I'm dating myself here, but I loved Blockbuster when it was around. Even before streaming, with Netflix mail in DVDs, I still went to my local Blockbuster to check out videos and rent videos and videogames. So yea, it wasn't 'dying' to me, which might be a small niche population. I still go to my local book store to buy my books and in my company, we always try to purchase from small businesses first. 

NOTE: ""To protect investors"" was a lot of comments previously; but I had positions in BABA and also VIAC and I did not feel protected when it plummeted, so now I'm calloused and put money aside for these ""stock bets"" (not options), even if it's just a few k. 

NOTE: People telling me to just put it into index / ETFs; yes, I have those too. I'm not looking for 7-10% a year. I'm looking for some quick buck or two to feed into my FIRE. Happy with making 2-3% a month, but have been doing roughly 8-9% monthly. Also, these are for my leisure trading hobby. In at open, out when my target is reached , around 30-40%. Sometimes, I don't hold more than a day or two. I have a day job which is pretty stress free and gives me time to day trade (and learn about stuff). 

NOTE: Amazon vs (anyone): Yes, I saw the post in the other subreddit. This is NOT about that. My household does not have Prime, but I do give props to them for giving small businesses a store front to sell product, much like what eBay did many moons ago. 

NOTE: Thank you to folks sending me to that video game stock. I read the Due Diligence there. This is NOT about that.

Currently I am already big in tech (TEC), semi conductors (CHPS), (BTCC/ETHR) and lastly EDGE which focuses on Cyber Security, EV, Robotics, Automation, Genomics and Video Games.  When I look into the next decade and beyond I see big growth in the following.

Uranium - HURA

Lithium - HLIT

I dont have any positions in it yet but plan on opening a call.

Moderna , on the weekly chart it shows that the stock has been respecting the lower 300s support and just now is breaking out of that 3ish week long channel , we will see what happens next week but over all im bullish on it after that break out, i have a few calls for next week and hoping they print.

Msft, I  love this stock, one thing about it is that after it breaks out it consolidates for a bit before breaking out again. Its been coslidating around 300s for a while now so im expecting a break out soon. Plan on opening a position in it after seeing next weeks price action.

Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.

We are on an epic run of amazing proportions. I have been trading since the 90s and the Nasdaq boom, Nasdaq 5,000 at that time was epicâ¦. However, nothing I have ever seen is even close to the Nasdaq dropping near 6,000 March 2020 and now record highs every single day 15,500+ in a short periodâ¦ so I was curious for most of you which times were better. The first 4 months of trading/investing or the last 4 monthsâ¦

This may sound odd because the DOW, SP, NASDAQ keep making new highsâ¦however it is more of the blue chips and mega caps making new highs everyday. The Indexes and ETFS are all cap weighted except for the DOW, which means stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA can carry the market to new highs without aidâ¦.

For myself, I actually am not hitting record highs, I do take a lot of money out for real estate but even if I did not I know I would not beâ¦however the first 4 months I was! At that time a lot of the stocks I trade were making new highs. FEBRUARY/MARCH/APRIL especiallyâ¦.. JUNE/JULY for me were very rough and AUGUST I was coming back..

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8wqjy/a_beginner_and_intermediate_guide_to_options/) is what I can only assume to be a pretty good writeup on some stuff to look into options, but there's a certain paragraph  
&gt; (0.5 x 340) / 10 = 17. What this means is that this option lets you be leveraged 17:1 on a single call option. So if you put let's say $1,000 into this call or purchase 1 contract, you have a position that is equal to $17,000 on the SPY.

Does this mean I suddenly, magically have 17k to play with? If I were to close the entirety of this theoretical position, would I be sitting on 17k cold hard cash instead of the 1k I put in not a minute ago? 

This line of thinking got me wondering more broadly how are life changing amounts of money being made and lost in options. In my brief youtube research adventures, one point that particularly stuck out to me was that the contract price is multiplied by 100 to get the actual price you'd pay for that contract. Poking around the various options chains on my watchlists, it seems that generally you'd need several hundred to several thousand dollars just to get a single contract. 

Now obviously the more you invest (or gamble) the greater dollar change you'll see for better or worse.

Is there a portfolio manager that track multiple curries and calculate cost basis automatically?


I'm from Australia and trade ASX and NYSE shares. When i deposit AUD into my international brokers it charges me fees/crappier rates. Then i buy the shares i want in USD. 
I want the app to track how ive spent on those shares or track how much initial money were lost to fees/crap rates.


E.g. Deposit $10,000 AUD, receive 7000 USD (instead of 7500) (todays rate). Buy share 70 shares of XX at $100/share. Price per share broker tell me is $100/share which totals $7000US when in reality i spent $10,000 or $7500. So my actual share price was $107.14/share.

It may be one of the biggest banks in America. Here's why: The Starbucks card can be topped up with cash to spend at any Starbucks, giving users rewards for their purchases. 


The total balance on Starbucks cards is over $1.6 billion. In other words, customers are lending Starbucks $1.6 billion in cash... at 0% interest! 


To put that in perspective, 85% of US banks have less than $1b in total assets. 


Starbucks isn't regulated as a bank because users can't withdraw their balance as cash. 


This means they aren't effected by various regulations, including the need to hold a large cash balance in case of mass withdrawals. 


They are free to spend this loan on whatever they want, such as opening 350+ new stores per quarter. 
To top it off, the Starbucks app is the second most used mobile point-of-sale payment platform in the US, sitting between Apple Pay and Google Pay.

As the title suggests many stocks have doubled this week and last week. I have been banned on subs for naming tickers so I will know mention them here. You can message me, but the purpose of this post is so you too can be âThe Geniusâ. Everyone wants to double their money right away, but do understand the risk associated with these stocks. Yes, you can double your money the same day or next dayâ¦ but be ready to lose 50% as well..

So, I have 28 different watch lists.. The last time I actually counted was November of 2020, I had maybe 820 different tickers, and actually I had about 20 lists at that time. Over the last year I have edited/changed added lists and move some stocksâ¦I say this because it is very important what I do next. It is also important to add something moving to a watch list of your choice. I believe I have over 1,100 to 1,200 tickers on all different watch lists. The US market has between 12-13,000 tickers so I actually have 10% of the market at my fingertips.

I usually around 7AM wake up, read the news online, turn on CNBC.. Check Yahoo finance, CNBC siteâ¦ Soon after I will cycle thru my different watch lists, some that I already know have volatile speculation. If the stock that morning is up 10%, or has volume that looks like it will 2x average daily volume, I move it over to a list I call âPlaysâ. Why 10%? I have traded very long and my rule is 10%, it may be hot money todayâ¦..

Next I will check Yahoo finance, TD for premarket movers, same rule if it is up 10% or looks like double volume I will add it to my plays and another listâ¦. All the stocks that doubled the past 2 weeks were already on lists, because they were previously up 10% on high volumeâ¦.. yes, I know that is a lot of stocks, hence I have 1,200 tickers.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, thatâs only going to happen with a big âif.â  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.   
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasnât a priority for Tesla.  When asked about the Roadsterâs timeline today, Musk confirmed that it is now delayed to 2023.

*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend, with the Nasdaq outperforming, the S&amp;P 500 rising slightly and the Dow flat. The best-performing sectors were on the defensive side, led by real estate investment trusts, utilities, consumer staples and health care.

&gt; âYouâve got this Labor Day effect. People are back from vacationâ in the coming week, National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said.

&gt; Hogan said investors expect the trading activity to pick up as a result, but it typically remains slow in the holiday shortened-week. Investors may assess their summer performance and move to lock in gains or add hedges.
*****
&gt; âIf you look back at the last five post-Labor Day weeks that have happened with the market near all-time highs, the post Labor Day week is the worst for September,â Hogan said.

&gt; âMy outlook for the last several weeks is sideways to moderately higher, and that seems where theyâre headed. There isnât a lot of bearish data accumulating. At worst we go sideways,â said Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab managing director of trading and derivatives.
*****
&gt; Frederick said even with worries about the weaker jobs and Covid,-19 investors may continue to focus on profits. Economists blamed the spread of the Covid delta variant for the weaker than expected jobs report.
*****
&gt; Strategists say other issues for stocks in September could include the efforts in Congress to pass infrastructure legislation and possible new taxes.
*****
&gt; # Ignoring jobs report
*****
&gt; Frederick said he expects the market to look beyond the August employment report, which was about 500,000 lower than expected.
*****
&gt; âI donât think thereâs spillover much into next week for the most part,â he added. âThe markets are down a little bit, but I think theyâve taken it in stride better than might be expected.â
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims data Thursday could be even more important than usual because of the big miss in Augustâs employment report. Jobs data is important because that is one area where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he would like to see more improvement before the central bank can decide to slow its bond purchases.
*****
&gt; The market has been fixated on the Fedâs move to end its $120 billion a month bond-buying program because it is viewed as a precursor to interest rate hikes. However, Powell has stressed the two are not linked.
*****
&gt; âIf feels like [the jobs report] pushes the announcement of a taper to the November meeting, rather than the September meeting, and for the most part that was consensus,â Hogan said.
*****
&gt; Hogan said the market will also be watching any inflation-related data, so that makes Fridaysâ producer price index important after it surged last month. The consumer price index, released the following week, will be even more important for the market.
*****
&gt; NatWest Markets head of macro strategy John Briggs said the markets will be watching for any Fed-related headlines after the disappointing employment report.
*****
&gt; âNext week, you have [New York Fed President John] Williams speaking. His take will be important. Heâs viewed as being close to Powell,â Briggs said. Williams is set to speak Wednesday at a briefing on the economy.
*****
&gt; # Whatâs next for stocks
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the next big event for stocks will be the third-quarter earnings season, which gets underway in early October. Before that, investors will be watching for any company comments on results.
*****
&gt; Frederick said the strength of earnings has been propelling stocks and could keep doing so. â³The market was so overvalued for awhile until earnings caught up, but earnings were spectacular and now the valuations arenât as high as they were a few months ago, so we can do this,â he said.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected to increase by 29.8% for the third quarter after the second quarterâs stunning 95.6% increase, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; âThereâs a vacuum of earnings related news,â Frederick said, noting the market could be influenced by geopolitical events in the meantime.
*****
&gt; But even if the market loses steam, he doesnât expect a major sell-off because for now, dip buyers continue to come in whenever the market has a setback.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 0.6% at 4,535, versus a 1.5% move higher by the Nasdaq to 15,363, a new high. The Dow was flattish, off 0.2%, at 35,369.
*****
&gt; The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.32% late Friday, just above where it was a week ago.

&gt; # Weakness Day After Labor Day &amp; Sell Rosh Hashanah

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.04% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last nine years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last four years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the marketâs performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.33%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.14%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6a21f54090531d6af040908d26933cf6/3527e5164e79635b-f2/s500x750/6a6618593a7e03b8f169df02f72c6a0a63c53430.jpg))**

&gt; **Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur**

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, âSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.â It gets tossed around every autumn when the âhigh holidaysâ are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, âSell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,â pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away â and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 98 Stock Traderâs Almanac 2021). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. Itâs no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; Perhaps itâs Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 64% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%. This past year DJIA gained 19.9% from Yom Kippur 2020 to Passover 2021.

&gt; This year the high holidays arrive early on Labor Day eve, September 6, and end Thursday September 16 with Yom Kippur at mid-month one of the strongest days September. But with the market in full rally mode on easy Federal Reserve money and free Federal Government fiscal stimulus month selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays could trigger a mild correction of 5% or so. The end of September after Triple Witching is notoriously the weakest part of the month, so it may be more prudent to âbuyâ later in the month.

&gt; # Here Comes the Worst Month of the Year

&gt; The incredible bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up to a record 53 new all-time highs before August is over, topping the previous record from 1964.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; âAlthough this bull market has laughed at nearly all the worry signs in 2021, letâs not forget that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks,â explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âEven last year, in the face of a huge rally off the March 2020 lows, we saw a nearly 10% correction in the middle of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 hasnât had so much as a 5% correction since last October and with stocks up more than 100% since March 2020, investors should be open to some potential seasonal weakness. The good news is we remain in the camp that stocks will continue to go higher and investors should use any weakness as an opportunity to add to core equity holdings.

&gt; Letâs be honest, stocks canât go up forever. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is about to be up 7 months in a row, one of the longest monthly win streaks ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It is what happens next that has our attention. As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, after 7-month win streaks, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher six months later 13 out of 14 times, with a very impressive 7.8% average return. This reinforces our belief that in the event of a well-deserved pullback, it would be an opportunity to buy at cheaper prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; With a very highly anticipated Federal Reserve Bank meeting in September, along with continued Delta variant worries, coupled with the fact that stocks havenât pulled back in a long time, investors should be on the lookout for some seasonal volatility in September. We remain in the camp that any weakness, should it occur, could be short-term and likely be contained in the 5-8% range. This bull market is alive and well and we would view any potential weakness as an opportunity.

&gt; # August Payrolls Disappoint

&gt; It seems to be two steps forward, one step back for the U.S. labor market.

&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 235,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economistsâ median forecast for a gain of 733,000. This comes on the heels of a strong July during which payrolls climbed by an upwardly revised 1.053 million jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in August, in line with expectations, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate, which stayed at 61.7%.

&gt; âThe Delta variant surge is the unsurprising story behind Augustâs big payroll miss,â explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. âLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were flat month over month. The good news is that we see promising signs Deltaâs effect will wane in coming months and payrolls will resume growing at a fast clip.â

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, we remain 5.3 million payrolls shy of February 2020âs peak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.3.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The other key takeaway from this report is wage pressures are building. Average hourly earnings came in hotter than expected, an increasingly common occurrence, posting a 0.6% month-over-month gain versus expectations for 0.3%, and a 4.3% gain year over year versus expectations for 3.9%. Wages have important implications in the inflation debate, as they and rents are considered to be among the âstickierâ components of inflation. Todayâs report is likely to bolster those in the camp asserting inflation will be less transitory than the Federal Reserve (Fed) thinks, though it should be noted that the lack of employment growth in lower wage in-person sectors likely contributed to the higher wage numbers.

&gt; Looking ahead, we continue to believe there is reason to expect a strong jobs rebound in coming months. Schools closed for the summer, potential disincentives from enhanced unemployment benefits, and the troublesome Delta variant have all acted as speed limits on the pace of employment growth recently. Augustâs report, though, figures to be the last where all of these factors remain in full force. Enhanced unemployment benefits are set to expire on Labor Day (ironically), meaning their effects will only be present for part of the September reportâs observation window, and will be fully gone by the October report. Schools and daycare facilities, meanwhile, are beginning to reopen, freeing up parents to rejoin the labor force. And, most importantly, we are seeing promising signs that the worst of the latest flare-up in COVID-19 cases may be behind us.

&gt; Zooming out, this job report has the potential to delay the Fedâs tapering timeline. Fed Chair Powell has made it clear that the labor market will serve as his tell regarding when to begin tapering asset purchases. With todayâs big payroll miss, it is clear the labor market is under some near term pressure, and while these pressures are likely to dissipate the Fed will probably err on the side of caution to avoid acting prematurely. The next month is sure to be an interesting one for Fed-watchers.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Finally Rises in Back to Back Weeks

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has continued to press higher resulting in a coincident rise in sentiment. The AAII's weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose back above 40% for the first time since the week of July 8th. While 43.4% is not a particularly elevated reading on sentiment (72nd percentile of all periods), the move higher is particularly notable in that it was the first time bullish sentiment has risen in back-to-back weeks since February. That is especially surprising given the fact that bullish sentiment was very elevated at points between now and then, such as back in the spring when it eclipsed 50%. That is also a historically long stretch of time without back-to-back increases in bullish sentiment. As shown in the second chart below, at just over half of a year-long, the only two similar streaks on record were in 1995 and from 1997 to 1998.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Back-to-Back.png))**

&gt; Negative sentiment has broadly picked up over the past couple of months. In the AAII survey, bearish sentiment was slightly higher at 33.3% versus 33% last week. While below the peak from only a couple of weeks ago, that is still elevated versus readings from earlier this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers has also seen bearish sentiment on the rise throughout the summer. This week, it topped 20% for the first time since March 10th. At 21.3%, bearish sentiment in this survey is at the highest level since last October. With that said, the current reading is also well below the 20 year average of 24.19%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-II-Bear.png))**

&gt; As a result of the larger gains to bullish versus bearish sentiment, optimism remains the favored response in the AAII survey. The bull-bear spread rose back into positive double digits this week for the first time since the last week of July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/090221-AAII-Bull-Bear-Spread.png))**

&gt; Given both bullish and bearish sentiments were higher, neutral sentiment has continued to unwind. That reading fell 4.3 percentage points this week to a new low of 23.2%. That was the fourth decline in the past five weeks as neutral sentiment came in at the lowest level since mid-April.

&gt; # Emerging Markets Leave China Behind

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the record underperformance of Chinese equities relative to the US over the past six months. As a result of the weakness in Chinese equities, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM)âwhich has roughly a 37% weight in Hong Kong and Chinese stocksâis well off of its highs and has been trending lower over the past several months. Today, EEM is up a healthy 1.37%, but that brings it just short of its 50-DMA which recently fell below its 200-DMA. That is also at similar levels to the lower high from the start of this month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EEM.png))**

&gt; When factoring out China, emerging markets look much better. Again, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF that excludes China (EMXC) is currently 1.13% below its 52-week high, but the downtrend that has been in place since the early June highs has been on the ropes over the past couple of sessions. Yesterday saw the ETF trade and close right at that downtrend line, but the 1.15% gain today has smashed through it. That leaves EMXC at the highest level since June 15th. The ETF is also at some of the most overbought levels (1.8 standard deviations from its 50-DMA) since then.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMXC.png))**

&gt; Pivoting over to bonds, looking at the Fixed Income screen of our Trend Analyzer, the best performer over the past five days is also in the EM space. The USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB) had been mostly flat throughout the summer trending right alongside its sideways 50- and 200-DMAs. Significant gains last Friday and yesterday led EMB to break out of that range as it reaches some of the highest levels since February today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/083121-EMB.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, EMB has not ventured far from its 50-DMA recently. In fact, the rolling 50-day standard deviation has been right around some of the lowest levels on record since EMB began trading in 2008. Given that lack of volatility, the rip higher this week has resulted in the ETF moving well beyond the upper end of its narrow trading range. In fact, yesterday the ETF closed over 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA. That joins only 14 other days where the ETF closed at least 3 standard deviations above its 50-DMA with the most recent of those back in June 2019 when it reached as high as 4 standard deviations above its moving average.

-Has shown the ability to make steady returns. If the chart is a steadily upward sloping line over many years (preferably its entire history) it is a major plus.

I guess the argument would be Lucid could potentially have a better driving experience with more range for their batteries but you are paying like 5-6x more for a Lucid than an Xpeng.  Also maybe people are weary of Xpeng being in China which has pros and cons.

Stocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly â of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous monthâs numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, âWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what weâve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.â

This is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the âsubstantial further progress markâ the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, âI think that one more good job report if itâs in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.â Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report âWhat weâre seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, weâve been in a monetary-driven market for so long itâs hard to say that monetary factors arenât at the forefront of the marketâs mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here â¦ we canât really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But thereâs stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.â

**Highlights**

* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.
* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.
* Dishâs (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. 
* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Appleâs in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Gamesâ original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.
* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Partyâs drive to âcommon prosperityâ. 
* Beyond Meats (BYND) COO Sanjay Shah steps down from his role with no public explanation given. He originally joined the company from Tesla in 2019
